**Singapore in the Straits Settlements** refers to a period in the [history of
Singapore](/wiki/History_of_Singapore "History of Singapore") between 1826 and
1942, during which [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore "Singapore") was part of the
[Straits Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements "Straits Settlements")
together with [Penang](/wiki/Penang "Penang") and [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca
"Malacca"). Singapore was the [capital](/wiki/Capital_city "Capital city") and
the [seat of government](/wiki/Seat_of_government "Seat of government") of the
Straits Settlement after it was moved from [George
Town](/wiki/George_Town,_Penang "George Town, Penang") in 1832.[1]

From 1830 to 1867, the Straits Settlements was a residency, or subdivision, of
the [Presidency of Bengal](/wiki/Bengal_Presidency "Bengal Presidency"), in
[British India](/wiki/British_India "British India"). In 1867, the Straits
Settlements became a separate [Crown colony](/wiki/Crown_colony "Crown
colony"), directly overseen by the [Colonial Office](/wiki/Colonial_Office
"Colonial Office") in [Whitehall](/wiki/Whitehall "Whitehall") in London. The
period saw Singapore establish itself as an important trading port and
developed into a major city with a rapid increase in population. The city
remained as the capital and seat of government until British rule was
suspended in [February 1942](/wiki/February_1942 "February 1942"), when the
[Imperial Japanese Army](/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army "Imperial Japanese
Army") [invaded Singapore](/wiki/Battle_of_Singapore "Battle of Singapore")
during [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II").

## Beginning of British rule in Singapore

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements&action=edit&section=1
"Edit section: Beginning of British rule in Singapore")]

In 1819, the British official, [Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles
"Stamford Raffles"), landed in Singapore to [establish a trading
port](/wiki/Founding_years_of_modern_Singapore "Founding years of modern
Singapore"). The island's status as a British outpost was initially in doubt,
as the [Dutch government](/wiki/Batavian_Republic "Batavian Republic") soon
issued bitter protests to the British government, arguing that their sphere of
influence had been violated. The British government and the [East India
Company](/wiki/East_India_Company "East India Company") were initially worried
about the potential liability of this new outpost, but that was soon
overshadowed by Singapore's rapid growth as an important trading post. By
1822, it was made clear to the Dutch that the British had no intention of
giving up the island.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed
"Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The status of Singapore as a British possession was cemented by the [Anglo-
Dutch Treaty of 1824](/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Treaty_of_1824 "Anglo-Dutch Treaty of
1824"), which carved up the Malay archipelago between the two colonial powers.
The area north of the [Straits of Malacca](/wiki/Straits_of_Malacca "Straits
of Malacca"), including [Penang](/wiki/Penang "Penang"),
[Malacca](/wiki/Malacca "Malacca") and Singapore, was designated as the
British sphere of influence, while the area south of the Straits was assigned
to the Dutch.

This division had far-reaching consequences for the region: modern-day
[Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia "Malaysia") and Singapore correspond to the British
area established in the treaty, and modern-day [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia
"Indonesia") to the Dutch. In 1826, Singapore was grouped together with Penang
and Malacca into a single administrative unit, the [Straits
Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements "Straits Settlements"), under the
administration of the [East India Company](/wiki/East_India_Company "East
India Company").

## Residency of Bengal Presidency (1830–1867)

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements&action=edit&section=2
"Edit section: Residency of Bengal Presidency \(1830–1867\)")]

In 1830, the Straits Settlements became a residency, or subdivision, of the
[Presidency of Bengal](/wiki/Bengal_Presidency "Bengal Presidency"), in
[British India](/wiki/British_India "British India").[2] This status continued
until 1867.

### Trade and economy

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements&action=edit&section=3
"Edit section: Trade and economy")]

of the harbour of Singapore, 1860.

During the subsequent decades, Singapore grew to become one of the most
important ports in the world. Several events during this period contributed to
its success. British intervention in the Malay peninsula from the 1820s
onwards culminated, during the 1870s, in the formation of [British
Malaya](/wiki/British_Malaya "British Malaya"). During this period, Malaya
became an increasingly important producer of [natural
rubber](/wiki/Natural_rubber "Natural rubber") and [tin](/wiki/Tin "Tin"),
much of which was shipped out through Singapore.[3] Singapore also served as
the administrative centre for Malaya until the 1880s, when the capital was
shifted to [Kuala Lumpur](/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur "Kuala Lumpur").

In 1834, the British government ended the East India Company's monopoly on the
China trade, allowing other British companies to enter the market and leading
to a surge in shipping traffic. The trade with China was opened with the
signing of the [Unequal Treaties](/wiki/Unequal_Treaties_\(China\) "Unequal
Treaties \(China\)"), beginning in 1842. The advent of ocean-going
[steamships](/wiki/Steamboat "Steamboat"), which were faster and had a larger
capacity than [sailing ships](/wiki/Sailing_ship "Sailing ship"), reduced
transportation costs and led to a boom in trade. Singapore also benefited by
acting as a coaling station for the [Royal Navy](/wiki/Royal_Navy "Royal
Navy") and merchant ships. The opening of the [Suez Canal](/wiki/Suez_Canal
"Suez Canal") in 1869 dramatically reduced the travel time from Europe to East
Asia, again providing a boost for trade.

By 1880, over 1.5 million tons of goods were passing through Singapore each
year, with around 80% of it transported by steamships and trading ships.[4]
The main commercial activity was [entrepôt](/wiki/Entrep%C3%B4t "Entrepôt")
trade which flourished under no taxation and little restriction. Many merchant
houses were set up in Singapore mainly by European trading firms, but also by
Jewish, Chinese, Arab, Armenian, American and Indian merchants. There were
also many Chinese middlemen who handled most of the trade between the European
and Asian merchants.[2]

### Civil service

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements&action=edit&section=4
"Edit section: Civil service")]

Despite Singapore's growing importance, the administration set up to govern
the island was generally understaffed, poorly funded, weak, and ineffectual.
Administrators were usually posted from India with little or no knowledge of
the region, and were unfamiliar with local languages and customs of the
people. As long as British trade was not affected, the administration was
unconcerned with the welfare of the populace.

While Singapore's population had quadrupled between 1830 and 1867, the size of
the civil service in Singapore had remained unchanged. In 1850 there were only
twelve police officers to keep order in a city of nearly 60,000. Most people
had no access to public health services, and diseases such as
[cholera](/wiki/Cholera "Cholera") and [smallpox](/wiki/Smallpox "Smallpox")
caused severe health problems, especially in overcrowded working-class areas.
Malnutrition and opium-smoking were major social woes during this period.

### Society

[shophouses](/wiki/Shophouse "Shophouse") running along a street in Chinatown,
which reflects the [Victorian architecture](/wiki/Victorian_architecture
"Victorian architecture") of buildings built in Singapore during the earlier
colonial period, with styles such as the [painted ladies](/wiki/Painted_ladies
"Painted ladies").

As early as 1827, the Chinese had become the largest ethnic group in
Singapore. During the earliest years of the settlement, most of the Chinese in
Singapore had been Peranakans, the descendants of Chinese who had settled in
the archipelago centuries ago, who were usually well-to-do merchants. As the
port developed, much larger numbers of Chinese [coolies](/wiki/Coolie
"Coolie") flocked to Singapore looking for work. These [migrant
workers](/wiki/Migrant_worker "Migrant worker") were generally male, poor and
uneducated, and had left [China](/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty") (mostly
from southern China) to escape the political and economic disasters in their
country.

They aspired to make their fortune in [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia
"Southeast Asia") and return home to China, but most were doomed to a life of
low-paying unskilled labour. Until the 20th century, few Chinese ended up
settling permanently, primarily because wives were in short supply. The sex
ratio in Singapore's Chinese community was around hundred to one, mainly due
to restrictions that the Chinese government imposed, up until the 1860s, on
the migration of women.

[Malays](/wiki/Malay_people "Malay people") in Singapore were the second
largest ethnic group in Singapore until the 1860s. Although many of the Malays
continued to live in [kampungs](/wiki/Kampung "Kampung"), or the traditional
Malay villages, most worked as wage earners and craftsmen. This was in
contrast to most Malays in Malaya, who remained farmers.

By 1860, Indians became the second largest ethnic group. They consisted of
unskilled labourers like the Chinese coolies, traders, soldiers garrisoned at
Singapore by the government in [Calcutta](/wiki/Calcutta "Calcutta"),[2] as
well as a number of Indian convicts who were sent to Singapore to carry out
public works projects, such as clearing jungles and swampy marshes and laying
out roads. They also helped construct many buildings, including [St. Andrew's
Cathedral](/wiki/St._Andrew%27s_Cathedral,_Singapore "St. Andrew's Cathedral,
Singapore"), and many Hindu temples. After serving their sentences, many
convicts chose to stay in Singapore.

As a result of the administration's hands-off attitude and the predominantly
male, transient, and uneducated nature of the population, the society of
Singapore was rather lawless and chaotic.
[Prostitution](/wiki/Prostitution_in_Singapore "Prostitution in Singapore"),
gambling, and [drug abuse](/wiki/Drug_abuse "Drug abuse") (particularly of
opium) were widespread. Chinese criminal [secret
societies](/wiki/Secret_societies_in_Singapore "Secret societies in
Singapore") (analogous to modern-day [triads](/wiki/Triad_society "Triad
society")) were extremely powerful; some had tens of thousands of members, and
turf wars between rival societies occasionally led to death tolls numbering in
the hundreds. Attempts to suppress these secret societies had limited success,
and they continued to be a problem well into the 20th century.[5]

The colonial division of the [architecture of
Singapore](/wiki/Architecture_of_Singapore "Architecture of Singapore")
developed in this period, recognisable elements which remain today in the form
of [shophouses](/wiki/Shophouse "Shophouse"), such as those found in Little
India or Chinatown.

## Crown colony (1867–1942)

Governor, Chief Justice, Members of Council and company of the Straits
Settlements in Singapore, circa 1860–1900.

As Singapore continued to grow, the deficiencies in the Straits Settlements
administration became increasingly apparent. Apart from the indifference of
British India's administrators to local conditions, there was immense
bureaucracy and red tape which made it difficult to pass new laws. Singapore's
merchant community began agitating against British Indian rule, in favour of
establishing Singapore as a separate colony of Britain. The British government
finally agreed to make the Straits Settlements a [Crown
colony](/wiki/Crown_colony "Crown colony") on 1 April 1867, receiving orders
directly from the Colonial Office rather than from India.

As a Crown Colony, the Straits Settlements was ruled by a governor, based in
Singapore, with the assistance of
[executive](/wiki/Executive_Council_\(Commonwealth_countries\) "Executive
Council \(Commonwealth countries\)") and [legislative
councils](/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_the_Straits_Settlements "Legislative
Council of the Straits Settlements"). Although the councils were not elected,
more representatives for the local population were gradually included over the
years.

### Chinese protectorate

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements&action=edit&section=7
"Edit section: Chinese protectorate")]

The colonial government embarked on several measures to address the serious
social problems facing Singapore. For example, a [Chinese
Protectorate](/wiki/Chinese_Protectorate "Chinese Protectorate") under
[Pickering](/wiki/William_Pickering_\(Singapore\) "William Pickering
\(Singapore\)") was established in 1877 to address the needs of the Chinese
community, including controlling the worst abuses of the coolie trade and
protecting Chinese women from forced prostitution. In 1889 Governor Sir [Cecil
Clementi Smith](/wiki/Cecil_Clementi_Smith "Cecil Clementi Smith") banned
[secret societies in colonial
Singapore](/wiki/Secret_societies_in_colonial_Singapore "Secret societies in
colonial Singapore"), driving them underground. Nevertheless, many social
problems persisted up through the post-war era, including an acute housing
shortage and generally poor health and living standards.

### Tongmenghui

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements&action=edit&section=8
"Edit section: Tongmenghui")]

In 1906, the [Tongmenghui](/wiki/Tongmenghui "Tongmenghui"), a revolutionary
Chinese organisation dedicated to the overthrow of the [Qing
dynasty](/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty") led by [Sun Yat-
Sen](/wiki/Sun_Yat-Sen "Sun Yat-Sen"), founded its
[Nanyang](/wiki/Nanyang_\(geographical_region\) "Nanyang \(geographical
region\)") branch in Singapore, which was to serve as the organisation's
headquarters in Southeast Asia. The [Tongmenghui](/wiki/Tongmenghui
"Tongmenghui") would eventually be part of several groups that took part in
the [Xinhai Revolution](/wiki/Xinhai_Revolution "Xinhai Revolution") and
established the [Republic of
China](/wiki/Republic_of_China_\(1912%E2%80%931949\) "Republic of China
\(1912–1949\)"). Overseas Chinese like the immigrant Chinese population in
Singapore donated generously to groups like the Tongmenghui, which would
eventually evolve into the [Kuomintang](/wiki/Kuomintang "Kuomintang"). Today,
this founding is commemorated in the [Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial
Hall](/wiki/Sun_Yat_Sen_Nanyang_Memorial_Hall "Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial
Hall") \- previously known as Sun Yat Sen Villa or Wang Qing Yuan (meaning
"House of the Heavens above" in Chinese) - in Singapore where the branch
operated from. According to [George Yeo](/wiki/George_Yeo "George Yeo"), the
Foreign Minister of Singapore, in those days the Kuomintang party flag, which
later became the [flag of the Republic of
China](/wiki/Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China "Flag of the Republic of China"),
was sewn in the Sun Yat Sen Villa by Teo Eng Hock and his wife.[6][7]

### [1915 Singapore Mutiny](/wiki/1915_Singapore_Mutiny "1915 Singapore
Mutiny")

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements&action=edit&section=9
"Edit section: 1915 Singapore Mutiny")]

Singapore was not directly affected by the [First World War](/wiki/World_War_I
"World War I") (1914–18), as the conflict did not spread to Southeast Asia.
The most significant event during the war was a [mutiny](/wiki/Mutiny
"Mutiny") in 1915 by [sepoys](/wiki/Sepoys "Sepoys") of the [5th Light
Infantry](/wiki/5th_Light_Infantry "5th Light Infantry") from British India
who were garrisoned in Singapore. On the day before the regiment was due to
depart for Hong Kong, and hearing rumours that they were to be sent to fight
the [Ottoman Empire](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"),[8] about half of
the Indian soldiers mutinied. They killed several of their officers and some
civilians before the mutiny was suppressed by British Empire and allied forces
plus local troops from [Johore](/wiki/Johore "Johore").[9]

### Singapore in the 1920s and 1930s

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements&action=edit&section=10
"Edit section: Singapore in the 1920s and 1930s")]

This is how [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew "Lee Kuan Yew"), its Prime
Minister for 32 years, described Singapore:

    I grew up in a Singapore of the 1920s and 1930s. The population was less than a million and most of Singapore was covered by mangrove swamps, rubber plantations, and secondary forest because rubber had failed, and forests around Mandai/Bukit Timah took its place.[10]

In these early decades, the island was riddled with [opium](/wiki/Opium
"Opium") houses and [prostitution](/wiki/Prostitution "Prostitution"), and
came to be widely monikered as "Sin-galore"[11]

### Naval base

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements&action=edit&section=11
"Edit section: Naval base")]

Victoria_Dock%2C_Tanjong_Pagar%2C_in_the_1890s.jpg)](/wiki/File:Victoria_Dock,_Tanjong_Pagar,_in_the_1890s.jpg)A
busy Victoria Dock, Tanjong Pagar, in the 1890s.

After the [First World War](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), the British
government devoted significant resources to building a [naval
base](/wiki/Singapore_Naval_Base "Singapore Naval Base") in Singapore, as a
deterrent to the increasingly ambitious [Japanese
Empire](/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan"). Originally announced in
1923, the construction of the base proceeded slowly until the [Japanese
invasion of Manchuria](/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria "Japanese invasion
of Manchuria") in 1931.

When completed in 1939, at the very large cost of $500 million, the base
boasted what was then the largest [dry dock](/wiki/Dry_dock "Dry dock") in the
world, the third-largest [floating dock](/wiki/Floating_dock_\(jetty\)
"Floating dock \(jetty\)"), and having enough fuel tanks to support the entire
British navy for six months. It was defended by heavy 15-inch naval guns
stationed at [Fort Siloso](/wiki/Fort_Siloso "Fort Siloso"), [Fort
Canning](/wiki/Fort_Canning "Fort Canning") and Labrador, as well as a [Royal
Air Force](/wiki/Royal_Air_Force "Royal Air Force") airfield at [Tengah Air
Base](/wiki/Tengah_Air_Base "Tengah Air Base"). [Winston
Churchill](/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill") touted it as the
"[Gibraltar](/wiki/Gibraltar "Gibraltar") of the East" and military
discussions often referred to the base as simply "[East of
Suez](/wiki/East_of_Suez "East of Suez")"

The base did not have a fleet. The [British Home
Fleet](/wiki/British_Home_Fleet "British Home Fleet") was stationed in Europe,
and the British could not afford to build a second fleet to protect its
interests in Asia.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed
"Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The so-called [Singapore
strategy](/wiki/Singapore_strategy "Singapore strategy") called for the Home
Fleet to sail quickly to Singapore in the event of an emergency. However,
after [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") broke out in 1939, the
fleet was fully occupied with defending Britain, and only the small [Force
Z](/wiki/Force_Z "Force Z") was sent to defend the colony.

People in Singapore who held German identify papers, including Jews fleeing
the Nazis such as [Karl Duldig](/wiki/Karl_Duldig "Karl Duldig"), [Slawa
Duldig](/wiki/Slawa_Duldig "Slawa Duldig"), and [Eva Duldig](/wiki/Eva_Duldig
"Eva Duldig"), were arrested and deported from Singapore.[12][13] The British
colonial government classified them as "citizens of an enemy
country".[14][15][13][16]
