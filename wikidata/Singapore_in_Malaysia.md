**Singapore** ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language "Malay language"): _Singapura_),
officially the **State of Singapore** ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language "Malay
language"): _Negeri Singapura_), was one of the 14 [states of
Malaysia](/wiki/States_and_federal_territories_of_Malaysia "States and federal
territories of Malaysia") from 1963 to 1965. [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia
"Malaysia") was formed on 16 September 1963 by the merger of the [Federation
of Malaya](/wiki/Federation_of_Malaya "Federation of Malaya") with the former
British colonies of [North Borneo](/wiki/Crown_Colony_of_North_Borneo "Crown
Colony of North Borneo"), [Sarawak](/wiki/Crown_Colony_of_Sarawak "Crown
Colony of Sarawak") and [Singapore](/wiki/Colony_of_Singapore "Colony of
Singapore"). This marked the end of the 144-year [British rule in
Singapore](/wiki/Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements "Singapore in the
Straits Settlements") which began with the [founding of modern
Singapore](/wiki/Founding_years_of_modern_Singapore "Founding years of modern
Singapore") by [Sir Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Sir_Stamford_Raffles "Sir Stamford
Raffles") in 1819.[2] At the time of merger, it was the smallest state in the
country by land area, but the largest by population.

The union was unstable due to distrust and ideological differences between the
leaders of Singapore and of the [federal government of
Malaysia](/wiki/Federal_government_of_Malaysia "Federal government of
Malaysia"). They often disagreed about finance, politics and racial policies.
Singapore continued to face significant trade restrictions despite promises of
a [common market](/wiki/Common_market "Common market") in return for a large
proportion of its tax revenues, and retaliated by withholding loans to
[Sabah](/wiki/Sabah "Sabah") and Sarawak. In politics, the Malay-based [United
Malays National Organisation](/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation
"United Malays National Organisation") (UMNO) and Singapore-based [People's
Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party "People's Action Party") (PAP),
[entered each other's political arenas](/wiki/PAP%E2%80%93UMNO_relations
"PAP–UMNO relations"), despite previous agreements not to do so.[3] These
resulted in major [race riots](/wiki/1964_race_riots_in_Singapore "1964 race
riots in Singapore") in Singapore in 1964, which were attributed (at least in
part) to instigation by UMNO and its Malay-language newspaper _[Utusan
Melayu](/wiki/Utusan_Melayu "Utusan Melayu")_ for [affirmative
action](/wiki/Affirmative_action "Affirmative action") for Malays in
Singapore.[4]

These culminated in the decision by Malaysian Prime Minister [Tunku Abdul
Rahman](/wiki/Tunku_Abdul_Rahman "Tunku Abdul Rahman") to expel Singapore from
the Federation, and on 9 August 1965, [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore "Singapore")
became independent.[5]

## Prelude to merger

[Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew "Lee Kuan Yew") and [Tunku Abdul
Rahman](/wiki/Tunku_Abdul_Rahman "Tunku Abdul Rahman")

Singapore politicians, beginning with [David
Marshall](/wiki/David_Saul_Marshall "David Saul Marshall") in 1955, repeatedly
courted [Tunku](/wiki/Tunku "Tunku") [Abdul Rahman](/wiki/Tunku_Abdul_Rahman
"Tunku Abdul Rahman") about merger with the Federation, but were rebuffed
repeatedly.[6] Tunku's chief consideration was the need to maintain the racial
balance in the Federation, UMNO's position in the Alliance Party, and Malay
political dominance. Including Singapore with its large Chinese population
would result in the Chinese (at 3.6 million) outnumbering the 3.4 million
Malays in the new union, and put it "at-risk".[7][8]

Balanced against this risk was his even greater fear of an independent
[Singapore](/wiki/Singapore "Singapore") outside the federation, particularly
if it fell under the control of an unfriendly government. As part of
[decolonisation](/wiki/Decolonization "Decolonization") and increasing British
disengagement from Malaya, constitutional talks on self-government for
Singapore between the [British Colonial Office](/wiki/Colonial_Office
"Colonial Office") in London and the Singapore Legislative Assembly had
already resulted in the 1958 State of Singapore Constitution, and a fully
elected and self-governing 51-seat Legislative Assembly in 1959.[9][10] Tunku
worried that the next round of constitutional talks would grant Singapore even
more independence and put the island beyond his or Britain's reach; as British
officials put it, a 'batik curtain' would descend across the Straits of Johor,
beyond which political elements and possibly even a 'communist Cuba' would
gather strength.[6] This fear became increasingly real to Tunku after 29 April
1961 when [Ong Eng Guan](/wiki/Ong_Eng_Guan "Ong Eng Guan") of the left-wing
[United Peoples' Party](/wiki/United_People%27s_Party_\(Singapore\) "United
People's Party \(Singapore\)") trounced the PAP candidate at the Hong Lim by-
election.[6][11]

Tunku was also worried about [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia "Indonesia"), the
other regional behemoth, which under [Sukarno](/wiki/Sukarno "Sukarno")'s
[Guided Democracy](/wiki/Guided_Democracy_in_Indonesia "Guided Democracy in
Indonesia") was becoming increasingly nationalistic and expansionist,
undertaking regional actions such as the [liberation of West New
Guinea](/wiki/West_New_Guinea_dispute "West New Guinea dispute").[_[citation
needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

With these considerations in mind, and although it was not apparent at the
time, Tunku had already been considering merger as early as June 1960. At a
meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, he mentioned to [Lord
Perth](/wiki/David_Drummond,_8th_Earl_of_Perth "David Drummond, 8th Earl of
Perth") of the [Colonial Office](/wiki/Colonial_Office "Colonial Office") that
he was open to a merger if a 'Grand Design' including not just Singapore but
also [British Borneo](/wiki/British_Borneo "British Borneo") could be offered
as some sort of package deal.[6] Not only would it greatly benefit the
territory, resources and population under his control, but the combination of
indigenous Bornean peoples and Peninsular Malays (collectively termed
[Bumiputera](/wiki/Bumiputera_\(Malaysia\) "Bumiputera \(Malaysia\)")) would
counterbalance the increased numbers of Singaporean Chinese.[_[citation
needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

On 27 May 1961 at the Foreign Correspondents Association of Southeast Asia,
Tunku announced that a closer association between Malaya, Singapore and the
Borneo territories was a distinct possibility. Furthermore, he was calling not
just for a customs union but a full union into a single political entity, the
Federation of Malaysia.[7]

### Referendum

### Malaysia Agreement

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_Malaysia&action=edit&section=3 "Edit
section: Malaysia Agreement")]

See also: [Malaysia Agreement](/wiki/Malaysia_Agreement "Malaysia Agreement")

Singapore-specific provisions included:

  * Singapore would retain control on education and labour. Defence, external affairs and internal security would come under the jurisdiction of the federal government [12]
  * Singapore would have only 15 seats in the federal parliament instead of 25 seats (as was entitled by the size of its electorate) in return for this increased autonomy [12]
  * Singapore would pay 40% of its total revenue to the federal government. It would disburse a $150 million loan to the Borneo territories, of which two-thirds would be interest-free for five years. A common market would be implemented over twelve years.[13][14]
  * Singapore citizens would become Malaysian citizens while retaining Singapore citizenship, but they could only vote in Singapore.[15]

## Merger

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_Malaysia&action=edit&section=4 "Edit
section: Merger")]

The merger was originally scheduled for 31 August 1963 to coincide with the
official [independence day of Malaya](/wiki/Independence_Day_\(Malaysia\)
"Independence Day \(Malaysia\)"). However, it was postponed by Tunku Abdul
Rahman to 16 September 1963, to accommodate a United Nations mission to North
Borneo and Sarawak to ensure that they really wanted a merger, which was
prompted by Indonesian objections to the formation of Malaysia.

Nonetheless, on 31 August 1963 (the original Malaysia Day), Lee Kuan Yew stood
in front of a crowd at the Padang in Singapore and unilaterally declared
Singapore's independence.[6] On 16 September 1963, coincidentally Lee's
fortieth birthday, he once again stood in front of a crowd at the Padang and
this time proclaimed Singapore as part of Malaysia. Pledging his loyalty to
the Central Government, Tunku and his colleagues, Lee asked for ‘an honourable
relationship between the states and the Central Government, a relationship
between brothers, and not a relationship between masters and servants'.[6]

### Independence from Britain

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_Malaysia&action=edit&section=6 "Edit
section: Independence from Britain")]

Singapore merged with Malaya to achieve independence from the British colonial
government. The British treatment of the locals since the [British
colonisation](/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire") of Singapore in 1819 and
the British failure to defend Singapore against Japanese invasion in February
1942 led to animosity and disdain against the British colonial rule in the
post-war years. These sentiments culminated in strikes and riots in Singapore,
such as the [Hock Lee Bus Riots](/wiki/Hock_Lee_bus_riots "Hock Lee bus
riots") and [the Anti-National Service
riots](/wiki/1954_National_Service_riots "1954 National Service riots") in the
1950s. By merging with Malaya, the British would not have a reason to continue
to rule over Singapore and use the communist threat as an excuse to rule over
Singapore. Only a merger with Malaya would release Singapore from the clutches
of British colonial rule and grant it absolute independence from the British.

### Economic security

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_Malaysia&action=edit&section=7 "Edit
section: Economic security")]

Singapore also wanted to merge with Malaya for economic reasons. Singapore was
facing serious unemployment problems in the early 1960s. By merging with
Malaya, Singapore believed to be able to overcome the unemployment crisis.
Unemployment became the most serious issue for the
[PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party "People's Action Party") government when
it assumed power to govern Singapore in 1959. The lack of natural resources,
the low literacy rate among the local population, and the lack of hinterland
caused the unemployment situation in Singapore to soar during the early 1960s.

Malaya was a large country blessed with natural resources. Singapore wished to
leverage Malaya's economic advantages by proposing a [common market
strategy](/wiki/Common_market "Common market") that would mutually benefit
both nations. The PAP administration believed that a merger would also provide
the locals an opportunity to find jobs in Malaya and thus alleviate the
chronic unemployment problem in Singapore. This policy eventually allowed the
party to continue their rule in Singapore.

### Anticommunism

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_Malaysia&action=edit&section=8 "Edit
section: Anticommunism")]

The merger was also proposed to suppress communism in both Singapore and
Malaya. The State of Emergency imposed by the British in Singapore and Malaya
from 1948 to 1960 is a reflection of the strength of the communist movement,
which was striving to replace British rule of Singapore and Malaya with a
communist government. The Emergency Rule was lifted in 1960, but the
anticommunist current in Southeast Asia remained. Malaya sought to use the
merger as a way to strengthen itself and the region in their fight against
communist influences.

## Post-merger

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_Malaysia&action=edit&section=9 "Edit
section: Post-merger")]

### Economic disagreement

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_Malaysia&action=edit&section=10 "Edit
section: Economic disagreement")]

The Singapore and federal governments disagreed over economic issues. As part
of the [Malaysia Agreement](/wiki/Malaysia_Agreement "Malaysia Agreement"),
Singapore agreed to contribute 40% of its total revenue to the federal
government and provide largely interest-free loans to [Sabah](/wiki/Sabah
"Sabah") and [Sarawak](/wiki/Sarawak "Sarawak"), in exchange for establishment
of a common market. However in July 1965, Malaysian Finance Minister [Tan Siew
Sin](/wiki/Tan_Siew_Sin "Tan Siew Sin") proposed raising the contribution to
60% and hinted "that unless Singapore agrees to pay more, the common market
would be slow in coming about".[14] This was refused by Singapore's Finance
Minister, [Goh Keng Swee](/wiki/Goh_Keng_Swee "Goh Keng Swee"), who accused
Kuala Lumpur of imposing tariffs on Singapore-made products. Both sides also
disagreed over the issuance of the loan, but agreed to refer this issue to the
World Bank for arbitration.

### Political disagreement

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_Malaysia&action=edit&section=11 "Edit
section: Political disagreement")]

Main article: [PAP-UMNO relations](/wiki/PAP-UMNO_relations "PAP-UMNO
relations")

The Federal Government of Malaysia, dominated by the [United Malays National
Organisation](/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation "United Malays
National Organisation") (UMNO), was concerned that as long as Singapore
remained in the Federation, the _[bumiputera](/wiki/Bumiputera_\(Malaysia\)
"Bumiputera \(Malaysia\)")_ policy of [affirmative
action](/wiki/Affirmative_action "Affirmative action") in favor of Malays and
the indigenous population would be undermined and therefore run counter to its
agenda of addressing economic disparities between racial groups. This stance
clashed with the PAP's repeated pledges for a "[Malaysian
Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysian_Malaysia "Malaysian Malaysia")" – the equal
treatment of all races in Malaysia by the government which should serve
Malaysian _citizens_ without any regard for the economic conditions of any
particular _race_. Another contributing factor was fear that the economic
dominance of [Singapore's port](/wiki/Port_of_Singapore "Port of Singapore")
would inevitably shift economical and political power away from [Kuala
Lumpur](/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur "Kuala Lumpur") in time, should Singapore remain in
the Federation.

### Racial tensions

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Singapore_in_Malaysia&action=edit&section=12 "Edit
section: Racial tensions")]

Racial tensions increased dramatically within a year. Despite the Malaysian
government conceding [citizenship](/wiki/Malaysian_nationality_law "Malaysian
nationality law") to the many Chinese immigrants after independence, the
Chinese in Singapore disdained the Federal policies of [affirmative
action](/wiki/Affirmative_action "Affirmative action"), which granted special
privileges to the Malays in [Article
153](/wiki/Article_153_of_the_Constitution_of_Malaysia "Article 153 of the
Constitution of Malaysia") of the [Constitution of
Malaysia](/wiki/Constitution_of_Malaysia "Constitution of Malaysia").
Financial and economic benefits were given to Malays and Islam was recognised
as the sole official religion, although non-Muslims maintained freedom of
worship. [Malays](/wiki/Malays_in_Singapore "Malays in Singapore") and
[Muslims in Singapore](/wiki/Islam_in_Singapore "Islam in Singapore") were
being increasingly incited by the Federal Government's accusations that the
PAP was mistreating the Malays.

Numerous racial riots resulted, and curfews were frequently imposed to restore
order. These were collectively termed the [1964 race
riots](/wiki/1964_race_riots_in_Singapore "1964 race riots in Singapore"), the
largest and deadliest of which occurred on 21 July 1964. The immediate
antecedent event was a speech by [Syed Jaafar Albar](/wiki/Syed_Jaafar_Albar
"Syed Jaafar Albar"), backed by Federation Deputy Prime Minister [Abdul Razak
Hussein](/wiki/Abdul_Razak_Hussein "Abdul Razak Hussein"), at the New Star
Cinema in Pasir Panjang on 12 July 1964, where he accused [Lee Kuan
Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew "Lee Kuan Yew") of being an oppressor and alleged that
the fate of the Malays was even worse than it was during the Japanese
occupation.[6] He declared to an excited audience of several thousand Malays
that "if there is unity, no force in this world can trample us down... Not one
Lee Kuan Yew, a thousand Lee Kuan Yew... we finish them off". The crowd
responded enthusiastically with cries to arrest Lee and [Othman
Wok](/wiki/Othman_Wok "Othman Wok"), and crush and kill them.[6] Events
escalated over the following week, culminating in an article in the [Utusan
Melayu](/wiki/Utusan_Melayu "Utusan Melayu") on 20 July 1964 titled 'Challenge
to all Malays to all Malays – UMNO Youths; Lee Kuan Yew Condemned; Teacher
forced student to smell pork – Protest'.[6][16] The day after on 21 July 1964,
[racial riots](/wiki/1964_race_riots_in_Singapore "1964 race riots in
Singapore") broke out during the celebratory procession of [Muhammad's
birthday](/wiki/Milad_al-Nabi "Milad al-Nabi") near [Kallang](/wiki/Kallang
"Kallang") Gasworks, resulting in 4 deaths and 178 injured at the end of that
first day, and 23 deaths and 454 injuries by the time the riot was
quelled.[17] More riots had broken out in September 1964. The prices for food
skyrocketed when the transportation system was disrupted during the unrest,
causing further hardship.

The external political situation was also tense at the time, with
[Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia "Indonesia") actively against the establishment of
the Federation of Malaysia. [President](/wiki/President_of_Indonesia
"President of Indonesia") [Sukarno](/wiki/Sukarno "Sukarno") of Indonesia
declared a state of _[Konfrontasi](/wiki/Indonesia-Malaysia_confrontation
"Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation")_ (Confrontation) against Malaysia, and
initiated military and other actions against the new nation, including the
[bombing of MacDonald House](/wiki/MacDonald_House_bombing "MacDonald House
bombing") in Singapore in March 1965 by Indonesian commandos which killed
three people.[18] Indonesia also conducted [seditious](/wiki/Sedition
"Sedition") activities to provoke the Malays against the Chinese.[19]

### Separation

Please see the [talk page](/wiki/Talk:Singapore_in_Malaysia "Talk:Singapore in
Malaysia") for more information. _( February 2023)_  
---|---  
  
On 7 August 1965, Prime Minister [Tunku Abdul Rahman](/wiki/Tunku_Abdul_Rahman
"Tunku Abdul Rahman"), seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed,
advised the [Parliament of Malaysia](/wiki/Parliament_of_Malaysia "Parliament
of Malaysia") that it should vote to expel Singapore from Malaysia.[20]
Despite last-ditch attempts by PAP leaders, including Lee Kuan Yew, to keep
Singapore as a state in the union, the Parliament on 9 August 1965 voted 126–0
in favour of the expulsion of Singapore, with Members of Parliament from
Singapore not present. On that day, a tearful Lee announced that Singapore was
a sovereign, independent nation and assumed the role of [Prime
Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore "Prime Minister of Singapore") of
the new nation. His speech included these words: "I mean for me it is a moment
of anguish because all my life… you see the whole of my adult life… I have
believed in merger and the unity of these two territories. You know it's a
people connected by geography, economics, and ties of kinship…"[21]

While it has previously been taken as historical common knowledge that
Singapore had been expelled from Malaysia unilaterally by the Kuala Lumpur
Government, recently declassified documents from the Albatross File (taken
from a 1980s interview where Goh referred to merger with Malaysia as an
"Albatross around [their] necks"), revealed that as early as July 1964,
negotiations had begun between the PAP and the Alliance.[22] In a handwritten
letter, Lee Kuan Yew formally authorised Goh Keng Swee to negotiate with
Alliance leadership in order to negotiate and plan the eventual exit of
Singapore from the Federation, and over the next year, the two parties
coordinated to arrange matters such that when the Tunku announced Singapore's
expulsion and the PAP were "forced" to establish an independent government, it
would be presented as a "fait accompli" that could not be jeopardised by
popular uproar or opposition, which was still in favour of merger.[23] Having
already reaped the political benefits of Operation Coldstore, the crippling of
the Singaporean Left, the detention of key [Barisan
Sosialis](/wiki/Barisan_Sosialis "Barisan Sosialis") leaders like Lim Chin
Siong, Lee and Goh both believed that this move would afford Singapore with
the "best of both worlds", both isolated from the communal turmoil which they
believed would inevitably engulf Malaysia while retaining the economic
benefits of access to the Malaysian markets.

Under [constitutional amendments](/wiki/Constitutional_amendment
"Constitutional amendment") passed in December that year, the new state became
the [Republic of Singapore](/wiki/Singapore "Singapore"), with the vice-regal
representative or [Yang di-Pertuan Negara](/wiki/Yang_di-Pertuan_Negara "Yang
di-Pertuan Negara"), [Yusof Ishak](/wiki/Yusof_Ishak "Yusof Ishak"), becoming
the first [President](/wiki/President_of_Singapore "President of Singapore"),
and the [Legislative Assembly](/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore
"Legislative Assembly of Singapore") becoming the [Parliament of
Singapore](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore "Parliament of Singapore"). These
changes were made retroactive to the date of Singapore's separation from
Malaysia. The [Malaya and British Borneo
dollar](/wiki/Malaya_and_British_Borneo_dollar "Malaya and British Borneo
dollar") remained legal tender until the introduction of the [Singapore
dollar](/wiki/Singapore_dollar "Singapore dollar") in 1967. Before the
currency split, there were discussions about a [common
currency](/wiki/Common_currency "Common currency") between the Malaysian and
Singaporean governments.[24] Meanwhile in Malaysia, Singapore ceased to be
represented in the Federal Parliament, and its High Court remained part of the
Federal Court structure until 1969.

Singapore's separation angered especially the political leaders in
[Sabah](/wiki/Sabah "Sabah") and [Sarawak](/wiki/Sarawak "Sarawak"), its two
other nation-building partners, for not being consulted by both the Federal
Government and the Singapore State Government.[25] Among them, [Chief Minister
of Sabah](/wiki/Chief_Minister_of_Sabah "Chief Minister of Sabah") [Fuad
Stephens](/wiki/Fuad_Stephens "Fuad Stephens"), then known as Donald Stephens,
in his letter to Lee Kuan Yew said: "I feel like Death. Tears, heartbreak and
completely lost and betrayed. Never in my wildest dreams did I see this
happening." In the Upper House, [Ong Kee Hui](/wiki/Ong_Kee_Hui "Ong Kee
Hui"), chairman of the [Sarawak United Peoples'
Party](/wiki/Sarawak_United_Peoples%27_Party "Sarawak United Peoples' Party")
(SUPP) questioned the justification for Malaysia's existence following
Singapore's separation, adding that the Malaysia Agreement is negotiated
between all parties that formed the country. [Abdul Razak
Hussein](/wiki/Abdul_Razak_Hussein "Abdul Razak Hussein"), [Deputy Prime
Minister of Malaysia](/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Malaysia "Deputy Prime
Minister of Malaysia"), in his address to the [University of
Malaya](/wiki/University_of_Malaya "University of Malaya") Graduates Society
at the Arts Lecture Theatre in Pantai Valley, [Kuala
Lumpur](/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur "Kuala Lumpur") on 1 September 1965, denied the
allegations and explained that the decision was made and announced in secrecy
due to the [Indonesia–Malaysia
Confrontation](/wiki/Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia_Confrontation
"Indonesia–Malaysia Confrontation").[26]
