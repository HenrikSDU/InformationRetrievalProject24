The history of the modern state of [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore "Singapore")
dates back to its founding in the early 19th century; however, evidence
suggests that a significant trading settlement existed on the
[island](/wiki/Singapore_Island "Singapore Island") in the 14th century. The
last ruler of the [Kingdom of Singapura](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura "Kingdom
of Singapura"), [Parameswara](/wiki/Parameswara_\(sultan\) "Parameswara
\(sultan\)"), was expelled by the [Majapahit](/wiki/Majapahit "Majapahit") or
the [Siamese](/wiki/Ayutthaya_Kingdom "Ayutthaya Kingdom") before he founded
[Malacca](/wiki/Malacca_Sultanate "Malacca Sultanate"). Singapore then came
under the [Malacca Sultanate](/wiki/Malacca_Sultanate "Malacca Sultanate") and
subsequently the [Johor Sultanate](/wiki/Johor_Sultanate "Johor Sultanate").
In 1819, British statesman [Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles "Stamford
Raffles") negotiated a treaty whereby Johor would allow the British to locate
a trading port on the island, ultimately leading to the establishment of the
[Crown colony of Singapore](/wiki/Founding_years_of_modern_Singapore "Founding
years of modern Singapore") in 1867. Important reasons for the rise of
Singapore were its nodal position at the tip of the Malay Peninsula flanked by
the Pacific and Indian Oceans, the presence of a natural sheltered harbour, as
well as its status as a free port.[1]

During [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), Singapore was
invaded and occupied by the [Japanese Empire](/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of
Japan") from 1942 to 1945. When the Japanese surrendered, Singapore reverted
to British control, with increasing levels of [self-government](/wiki/Self-
governance "Self-governance") being granted, resulting in [Singapore's
merger](/wiki/Singapore_in_Malaysia "Singapore in Malaysia") with the
[Federation of Malaya](/wiki/Federation_of_Malaya "Federation of Malaya") to
form [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia "Malaysia") in 1963. However, social unrest,
racial tensions, and political differences between Singapore's governing
[People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party "People's Action Party")

The Greco-Roman astronomer [Ptolemy](/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") (90–168)
identified a place called _Sabana_ at the tip of [Golden
Chersonese](/wiki/Golden_Chersonese "Golden Chersonese") (believed to be the
[Malay Peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula "Malay Peninsula")) in the second and
third century.[5] The earliest written record of Singapore may be in a Chinese
book _《吳時外國傳》_ from the third century, describing the island of _Pu Luo Chung_
([蒲](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%92%B2 "wikt:蒲")
[羅](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%BE%85 "wiktionary:羅")
[中](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD "wikt:中")).[6] This has been
proposed to be related to the [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language "Malay language")
name _"[Pulau Ujong](/wiki/Pulau_Ujong "Pulau Ujong")"_, or "island at the
end" (of the [Malay Peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula "Malay Peninsula")).[7]

In 1025 CE, [Rajendra Chola I](/wiki/Rajendra_Chola_I "Rajendra Chola I") of
the [Chola Empire](/wiki/Chola_Empire "Chola Empire") led forces across the
[Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean") and invaded the [Srivijayan
empire](/wiki/Srivijaya_empire "Srivijaya empire"), attacking several places
in [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia "Malaysia") and [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia
"Indonesia").[8][9] The Chola forces were said to have controlled
[Temasek](/wiki/Temasek "Temasek") (now [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore
"Singapore")) for a couple of decades.[10] The name Temasek however did not
appear in Chola records, but a tale involving a Raja Chulan (assumed to be
Rajendra Chola) and Temasek was mentioned in the semi-historical _[Malay
Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals "Malay Annals")_.[11]

The [Nagarakretagama](/wiki/Nagarakretagama "Nagarakretagama"), a
[Javanese](/wiki/Java_\(island\) "Java \(island\)") eulogy written in 1365,
referred to a settlement on the island called _[Tumasik](/wiki/Temasek
"Temasek")_ (possibly meaning "_Sea Town_ " or "_Sea Port_ ").[12] The name
[Temasek](/wiki/Temasek "Temasek") is also given in [Sejarah
Melayu](/wiki/Sejarah_Melayu "Sejarah Melayu") (_Malay Annals_), which
contains a tale of the founding of Temasek by a prince of Palembang, Sri Tri
Buana (also known as [Sang Nila Utama](/wiki/Sang_Nila_Utama "Sang Nila
Utama")) in the 13th century.[13]: 37 Sri Tri Buana landed on Temasek on a
hunting trip, and saw a strange beast said to be a lion. The prince took this
as an auspicious sign and founded a settlement called Singapura, which means
"Lion City" in Sanskrit. The actual origin of the [name
Singapura](/wiki/Names_of_Singapore "Names of Singapore") however is unclear
according to scholars.[14]

maps of [Zheng He](/wiki/Zheng_He "Zheng He") showing Temasek (淡馬錫) at the top
left, and Long Ya Men (龍牙門) on the right panel.

In 1320, the [Mongol Empire](/wiki/Mongol_Empire "Mongol Empire") sent a trade
mission to a place called _[Long Ya Men](/wiki/Long_Ya_Men "Long Ya Men")_ (or
_Dragon's Teeth Gate_), which is believed to be [Keppel
Harbour](/wiki/Keppel_Harbour "Keppel Harbour") at the southern part of the
island.[15] The Chinese traveller [Wang Dayuan](/wiki/Wang_Dayuan "Wang
Dayuan"), visiting the island around 1330, described _[Long Ya
Men](/wiki/Long_Ya_Men "Long Ya Men")_ as one of the two distinct settlements
in _[Dan Ma Xi](/wiki/Temasek "Temasek")_ (from Malay _[Temasek](/wiki/Temasek
"Temasek")_), the other being _[Ban Zu](/wiki/Ban_Zu "Ban Zu")_ (from Malay
_pancur_). _Ban Zu_ is thought to be present day [Fort Canning
Hill](/wiki/Fort_Canning_Hill "Fort Canning Hill"), and [recent
excavations](/wiki/Archaeology_in_Singapore "Archaeology in Singapore") in
Fort Canning found evidence indicating that Singapore was an important
settlement in the 14th century.[16][17] Wang mentioned that the natives of
_Long Ya Men_ (thought to be the _[Orang Laut](/wiki/Orang_Laut "Orang
Laut")_) and Chinese residents lived together in _Long Ya Men_.[18][19]
Singapore is one of the oldest locations where a Chinese community is known to
exist outside China, and the oldest confirmed by archaeological and historical
research.[20]

By the 14th century, the empire of [Srivijaya](/wiki/Srivijaya "Srivijaya")
had already declined, and Singapore was caught in the struggle between Siam
(now [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand "Thailand")) and the Java-based Majapahit
Empire for control over the Malay Peninsula. According to the [Malay
Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals "Malay Annals"), Singapore was defeated in one
Majapahit attack. The last king, [Sultan Iskandar
Shah](/wiki/Parameswara_\(king\) "Parameswara \(king\)") ruled the island for
several years, before being forced to [Melaka](/wiki/Melaka "Melaka") where he
founded the [Sultanate of Malacca](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Malacca "Sultanate of
Malacca").[21] Portuguese sources, however, indicated that Temasek was a
Siamese vassal whose ruler was killed by
[Parameswara](/wiki/Parameswara_\(sultan\) "Parameswara \(sultan\)") (thought
to be the same person as Sultan Iskandar Shah) from Palembang, and Parameswara
was then driven to Malacca, either by the Siamese or the Majapahit, where he
founded the [Malacca Sultanate](/wiki/Malacca_Sultanate "Malacca
Sultanate").[22] Modern archaeological evidence suggests that the settlement
on [Fort Canning](/wiki/Fort_Canning "Fort Canning") was abandoned around this
time, although a small trading settlement continued in Singapore for some time
afterward.[14]

The Malacca Sultanate extended its authority over the island and Singapore
became a part of the Malacca Sultanate.[7] However, by the time the Portuguese
arrived in the early 16th century, Singapura had already become "great ruins"
according to [Alfonso de Albuquerque](/wiki/Alfonso_de_Albuquerque "Alfonso de
Albuquerque").[23][24] In 1511, the Portuguese seized Malacca; the sultan of
Malacca escaped south and established the [Johor
Sultanate](/wiki/Johor_Sultanate "Johor Sultanate"), and Singapore then became
part of the sultanate. In 1613, the Portuguese destroyed the settlement in
Singapore, and the island sank into obscurity for the next two
centuries.[25][26]

[Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles "Stamford Raffles") by [James
Thomson](/wiki/James_Thomson_\(engraver\) "James Thomson \(engraver\)")

Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the [Malay
Archipelago](/wiki/Malay_Archipelago "Malay Archipelago") was gradually taken
over by the European colonial powers, beginning with the arrival of the
[Portuguese](/wiki/Portuguese_Empire "Portuguese Empire") at
[Malacca](/wiki/Malacca "Malacca") in 1509. The early dominance of the
Portuguese was challenged during the 17th century by the
[Dutch](/wiki/Dutch_colonial_empire "Dutch colonial empire"), who came to
control most of the ports in the region. The Dutch established a monopoly over
trade within the archipelago, particularly in spices, then the region's most
important product. Other colonial powers, including the
[British](/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire"), were limited to a relatively
minor presence.[27]

In 1818, Sir [Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles "Stamford Raffles") was
appointed as the Lieutenant Governor of the British colony at
[Bencoolen](/wiki/British_Bencoolen "British Bencoolen"). He was determined
that Great Britain should replace the Netherlands as the dominant power in the
archipelago, since the trade route between [China](/wiki/Qing_Dynasty "Qing
Dynasty") and [British India](/wiki/British_Raj "British Raj"), which had
become vitally important, passed through the archipelago. The Dutch had been
stifling British trade in the region by prohibiting the British from operating
in Dutch-controlled ports or by subjecting them to a high tariff. Raffles
hoped to challenge the Dutch by establishing a new port along the [Straits of
Malacca](/wiki/Straits_of_Malacca "Straits of Malacca"), the main ship
passageway for the India-China trade. He needed a third port since the British
only had the ports of [Penang](/wiki/Penang "Penang") and Bencoolen which were
not suitable, as Penang was too far off to protect British traders from
pirates and Bencoolen was not along the main trading road. The port had to be
strategically located along the main trade route between India and China and
in the middle of the Malay Archipelago. He convinced [Lord
Hastings](/wiki/Francis_Rawdon-Hastings,_1st_Marquess_of_Hastings "Francis
Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings"), the [Governor-General of
India](/wiki/Governor-General_of_India "Governor-General of India") and his
superior at the [British East India Company](/wiki/British_East_India_Company
"British East India Company"), to fund an expedition to seek a new British
base in the region.[27]

of Raffles by [Thomas Woolner](/wiki/Thomas_Woolner "Thomas Woolner") now
stands in Singapore, near Raffles's landing site in 1819.

Raffles arrived in Singapore on 28 January 1819, and soon recognised the
island as a natural choice for the new port. It lay at the southern tip of the
Malay peninsula, near the [Straits of Malacca](/wiki/Straits_of_Malacca
"Straits of Malacca"), and possessed a natural deep harbour, freshwater
supplies, and timber for repairing ships. It was also located along the main
trade route between India and China. Raffles found a small
[Malay](/wiki/Malays_\(ethnic_group\) "Malays \(ethnic group\)")
[settlement](/wiki/Human_settlement "Human settlement") at the mouth of the
[Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River "Singapore River"), with an estimated
population of about 150 that consisted of around 120 Malays and 30
Chinese.[28] headed by the [Temenggong](/wiki/Temenggung "Temenggung") and
Tengku Abdul Rahman. Around 100 of these Malays had originally moved to
Singapore from [Johor](/wiki/Johor "Johor") in 1811 led by the
[Temenggong](/wiki/Temenggung "Temenggung").[28] The entire island may have a
population of 1,000 including the various tribes and Orang Laut (sea
gypsies).[29] The island was nominally ruled by the [Sultan of
Johor](/wiki/Sultan_of_Johor "Sultan of Johor"), who was controlled by the
Dutch and the [Bugis](/wiki/Bugis "Bugis"). However, the
[Sultanate](/wiki/Sultanate "Sultanate") was weakened by factional division
and Tengku Abdul Rahman and his officials were loyal to Tengku Rahman's elder
brother [Tengku Long](/wiki/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor "Hussein Shah of Johor") who
was living in [exile](/wiki/Exile "Exile") in [Riau](/wiki/Riau_Islands "Riau
Islands"). With the Temenggong's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Tengku Long
back into Singapore. He offered to recognise Tengku Long as the rightful
Sultan of Johor, given the title of Sultan Hussein and provide him with a
yearly payment of $5,000 and $3,000 to the Temenggong; in return, Sultan
Hussein would grant the British the right to establish a trading post on
Singapore.[27] The [Treaty of Singapore](/wiki/1819_Singapore_Treaty "1819
Singapore Treaty") was signed on 6 February 1819 and modern Singapore was
born.[30][31]

When Raffles arrived, it was estimated that there were around 1,000 people
living in the whole of the island of Singapore, mostly local groups that would
become assimilated into [Malays](/wiki/Malays_in_Singapore "Malays in
Singapore") and a few dozen Chinese.[32][33] The population increased rapidly
soon after Raffles' arrival; the first census of 1824 shows that 6,505 out of
the 10,683 total were Malays and Bugis.[34] Large number of Chinese migrants
also started to enter Singapore just months after it became a British
settlement, by the census of 1826, there were already more Chinese than Malays
excluding Bugis and Javanese.[35] Due to continual migration from
[Malaya](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula "Malay Peninsula"), China, India and other
parts of Asia, Singapore's population had reached nearly 100,000 by 1871, with
over half of them Chinese.[36] Many early Chinese and Indian immigrants came
to Singapore to work in various plantations and tin mines and they were
predominantly male, and large number of them would return to their home
countries after they had earned enough money. However, an increasingly
significant number chose to stay permanently by the early to mid twentieth
century, and their descendants would form the bulk of Singapore's
population.[37][38]

_Plan of the Town of Singapore_ , or more commonly known as the _[Jackson
Plan](/wiki/Jackson_Plan "Jackson Plan")_ or _Raffles Town Plan_.

Raffles returned to [Bencoolen](/wiki/Bencoolen_\(city\) "Bencoolen \(city\)")
soon after the signing of the treaty and left Major [William
Farquhar](/wiki/William_Farquhar "William Farquhar") in charge of the new
settlement, with some artillery and a small regiment of Indian soldiers.
Establishing a trading port from scratch was a daunting endeavor. Farquhar's
administration was fairly funded and was prohibited from collecting port
duties to raise revenue as Raffles had decided that Singapore would be a [free
port](/wiki/Free_port "Free port"). Farquhar invited settlers to Singapore and
stationed a British official on [St. John's
Island](/wiki/Saint_John%27s_Island "Saint John's Island") to invite passing
ships to stop in Singapore. As news of the free port spread across the
archipelago, [Bugis](/wiki/Bugis "Bugis"), [Peranakan Chinese](/wiki/Peranakan
"Peranakan"), and [Arab](/wiki/Arab "Arab") traders flocked to the island,
seeking to circumvent the Dutch trade restrictions. During the starting year
of operation in 1819, $400,000 ([Spanish dollars](/wiki/Spanish_dollar
"Spanish dollar")) worth of trade passed through Singapore. By 1821, the
island's population had gone up to around 5,000, and the trade volume was $8
million. The population reached the 10,000 mark in 1824,[34] and with a trade
volume of $22 million, Singapore surpassed the long-established port of
[Penang](/wiki/Penang "Penang").[27]

Raffles returned to Singapore in October 1822 and became critical of many of
Farquhar's decisions, despite Farquhar's success in leading the settlement
through its difficult early years. For instance, in order to generate much-
needed revenue, Farquhar had resorted to selling licenses for gambling and the
sale of opium, which Raffles saw as social evils. Shocked at the disarray of
the colony as well as the tolerance of slave trade by Farquhar, Raffles set
about drafting a set of new policies for the settlement, such as banning of
slavery, closing of gambling dens, the prohibition of carrying of weapons, and
heavy taxation to discourage what he considered to be social vices such as
drunkenness and opium-smoking.[39] He also organised Singapore into functional
and ethnic subdivisions under the _[Raffles Plan of
Singapore](/wiki/Raffles_Plan_of_Singapore "Raffles Plan of Singapore")_.[27]
Today, remnants of this organization can still be found in the [ethnic
neighbourhoods](/wiki/Culture_of_Singapore "Culture of Singapore").[_[citation
needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] William
Farquhar was also stripped off his post to be replaced by [John
Crawfurd](/wiki/John_Crawfurd "John Crawfurd"), an efficient and frugal
administrator, as the new governor.[40] Farquhar later died in
[Perth](/wiki/Perth,_Scotland "Perth, Scotland"), [Scotland](/wiki/Scotland

On 7 June 1823, [John Crawfurd](/wiki/John_Crawfurd "John Crawfurd") signed a

to most of the island. The Sultan and Temenggong traded most of their
administrative rights of the island, including the collection of port taxes
for lifelong monthly payments of $1500 and $800 respectively. This agreement
brought the island under the [British Law](/wiki/United_Kingdom_law "United

customs, traditions and religion.[27] In October 1823, Raffles departed for
Britain and would never return to Singapore as he died in 1826, at the age of

colonial period, with styles such as the [painted ladies](/wiki/Painted_ladies
"Painted ladies").

The status of a British outpost in Singapore seemed initially in doubt as the
Dutch government soon protested to Britain for violating the Netherlands'
sphere of influence. But as Singapore rapidly emerged as an important trading
post, Britain consolidated its claim on the island. The [Anglo-Dutch Treaty of
1824](/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Treaty_of_1824 "Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824") cemented
the status of Singapore as a British possession, carving up the Malay
archipelago between the two colonial powers with the area north of the Straits
of Malacca, including Singapore, falling under Britain's sphere of influence.
In 1826, Singapore was grouped by the British East India Company[42] together
with Penang and Malacca to form the [Straits
Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements "Straits Settlements"), administered by
the [British East India Company](/wiki/British_East_India_Company "British
East India Company"). In 1830, the Straits Settlements became a _residency_ ,
or subdivision, of the [Bengal Presidency](/wiki/Bengal_Presidency "Bengal
Presidency") in [British India](/wiki/British_India "British India").[43]

During the subsequent decades, Singapore grew to become an important port in
the region. Its success was due to several reasons including the opening of
the Chinese market, the advent of ocean-going [steamships](/wiki/Steamboat
"Steamboat"), the dramatic reduction in the time and cost of shipping goods to
Europe after the opening of the [Suez Canal](/wiki/Suez_Canal "Suez Canal") in
1869,[44] and the production of rubber and tin in Malaya.[45] The Malay
Peninsula had not featured significantly in Singapore's trade until the 1840s,
when the Chinese developed tin-mining in the West coast Malay States and
gambier-pepper cultivation in Johor.[1]

Its status as a free port provided a crucial advantage over other colonial
port cities in Batavia (now [Jakarta](/wiki/Jakarta "Jakarta")) and
[Manila](/wiki/Manila "Manila") where tariffs were levied, and it drew many
Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Arab traders operating in South-East Asia to
Singapore. Steamships had to frequently bunker and therefore take the route
along the South Asian coast line which also preferred Singapore over
Batavia.[1] The later opening of the [Suez Canal](/wiki/Suez_Canal "Suez
Canal") in 1869 would further boost trade in Singapore. By 1880, over 1.5
million tons of goods were passing through Singapore each year, with around
80% of the cargo transported by steamships.[46] The main commercial activity
was [entrepôt](/wiki/Entrep%C3%B4t "Entrepôt") trade which flourished under no
taxation and little restriction. Many merchant houses were set up in Singapore
mainly by European trading firms, but also by Jewish, Chinese, Arab, Armenian,
American and Indian merchants. There were also many Chinese middlemen who
handled most of the trade between the European and Asian merchants.[43]

By 1827, the Chinese had become the largest ethnic group in Singapore and by
1845 formed more than half of its population.[47] They consisted of
[Peranakans](/wiki/Peranakan "Peranakan"), who were descendants of early
Chinese settlers, and Chinese [coolies](/wiki/Coolie "Coolie") who flocked to
Singapore to escape economic hardship in southern China. Their numbers were
swelled by those fleeing the turmoil caused by the [First Opium
War](/wiki/First_Opium_War "First Opium War") (1839–1842) and [Second Opium
War](/wiki/Second_Opium_War "Second Opium War") (1856–1860). Many arrived in
Singapore as impoverished [indentured laborers](/wiki/Indentured_servant
"Indentured servant"). The Malays were the second largest ethnic group until
the 1860s and they worked as fishermen, craftsmen, or as wage earners while
continued to live mostly in [kampungs](/wiki/Kampung "Kampung"). By 1860, the
Indians had become the second-largest ethnic group. They consisted of
unskilled labourers, traders, and convicts who were sent to carry out public
works projects such as clearing jungles and laying out roads. There were also
Indian [Sepoy](/wiki/Sepoy "Sepoy") troops garrisoned at Singapore by the
British.[43]

Despite Singapore's growing importance, the administration governing the
island was understaffed, ineffectual, and unconcerned with the welfare of the
populace. Administrators were usually posted from India and were unfamiliar
with local culture and languages. While the population had quadrupled from
1830 to 1867, the size of the civil service in Singapore had remained
unchanged. Most people had no access to public health services and diseases
such as [cholera](/wiki/Cholera "Cholera") and [smallpox](/wiki/Smallpox
"Smallpox") caused severe health problems, especially in overcrowded working-
class areas.[43] As a result of the administration's ineffectiveness and the
predominantly male, transient, and uneducated nature of the population, the
society was lawless and chaotic. In 1850 there were only twelve police
officers in the city of nearly 60,000 people. Prostitution, gambling, and drug
abuse (particularly of opium) were widespread. Chinese criminal [secret
societies](/wiki/Secret_societies_in_Singapore "Secret societies in
Singapore") (analogous to modern-day [triads](/wiki/Triad_society "Triad
society")) were extremely powerful, and some had tens of thousands of members.
Turf wars between rival societies occasionally led to hundreds of deaths and
attempts to suppress them had limited success.[48]

The situation created a deep concern in the European population of the island.
In 1854 the _[Singapore Free Press](/wiki/Singapore_Free_Press "Singapore Free
Press")_ complained that Singapore was a "small island" full of the "very

As Singapore continued to grow, the deficiencies in the Straits Settlements
administration became serious and Singapore's merchant community began
agitating against British Indian rule. The British government agreed to
establish the Straits Settlements as a separate [Crown
Colony](/wiki/Crown_Colony "Crown Colony") on 1 April 1867. This new colony
was ruled by a governor under the supervision of the [Colonial
Office](/wiki/Colonial_Office "Colonial Office") in London. An [executive
council](/wiki/Executive_Council_\(Commonwealth_countries\) "Executive Council
\(Commonwealth countries\)") and a [legislative
council](/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_the_Straits_Settlements "Legislative
Council of the Straits Settlements") assisted the governor.[50] Although
members of the councils were not elected, more representatives for the local
population were gradually included over the years.

The colonial government embarked on several measures to address the serious
social problems facing Singapore. A [Chinese
Protectorate](/wiki/Chinese_Protectorate "Chinese Protectorate") under
[Pickering](/wiki/William_A._Pickering "William A. Pickering") was established
in 1877 to address the needs of the Chinese community, especially in
controlling the worst abuses of the coolie trade and protecting Chinese women
from forced prostitution.[50] In 1889 Governor Sir [Cecil Clementi
Smith](/wiki/Cecil_Clementi_Smith "Cecil Clementi Smith") banned secret
societies, driving them underground.[50] Nevertheless, many social problems
persisted up through the post-war era, including an acute housing shortage and
poor health and living standards. In 1906, the [Tongmenghui](/wiki/Tongmenghui
"Tongmenghui"), a revolutionary Chinese organisation dedicated to the
overthrow of the [Qing Dynasty](/wiki/Qing_Dynasty "Qing Dynasty") and led by
[Sun Yat-sen](/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen "Sun Yat-sen"), founded its
[Nanyang](/wiki/Nanyang_\(geographical_region\) "Nanyang \(geographical
region\)") branch in Singapore, which served as the organisation's
headquarters in Southeast Asia.[50] The members of the branch included Wong
Hong-Kui (黃康衢),[51] Tan Chor Lam and [Teo Eng Hock](/wiki/Teo_Eng_Hock "Teo
Eng Hock"). Chan Cho-Nam (陳楚楠, 1884–1971, originally a rubber
manufacturer)[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed
"Wikipedia:Citation needed")_], Cheung Wing-Fook (張永福, originally a rubber
shoe manufacturer)[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed
"Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] and Chan Po-Yin (陳步賢, 1883–1965) started
_[Chong Shing Yit Pao](/wiki/Chong_Shing_Yit_Pao "Chong Shing Yit Pao")_ , a
Chinese-language newspaper, in response to the growing influence of _[The
Union Times](/w/index.php?title=The_Union_Times&action=edit&redlink=1 "The
Union Times \(page does not exist\)")_ , which was controlled by reformists.
The inaugural edition of the newspaper was published on 20 August
1907.[52][53] The paper folded in 1910 due to financial difficulties.[54]
Working with other Cantonese people, Chan, Cheung and Chan opened the
revolution-related Kai Ming Bookstore (開明書報社, 開明 meaning open-mindedness and
wisdom)[55] in Singapore. For the revolution, Chan Po-Yin raised over 30,000
yuan for the purchase and shipment (from Singapore to China) of military
equipment and for the support of the expenses of people travelling from
Singapore to China for revolutionary work.[56][57] The immigrant Chinese
population in Singapore donated generously to Tongmenghui, which organised the
1911 [Xinhai Revolution](/wiki/Xinhai_Revolution "Xinhai Revolution") that led
to the establishment of the [Republic of
China](/wiki/Republic_of_China_\(1912%E2%80%931949\) "Republic of China

[World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") (1914–1918) did not deeply
affect Singapore: the conflict did not spread to Southeast Asia. The only
significant local military event during the war was a [1915
mutiny](/wiki/1915_Singapore_Mutiny "1915 Singapore Mutiny") by the British
Muslim Indian [sepoys](/wiki/Sepoy "Sepoy") garrisoned in Singapore.[58] After
hearing rumors of plans to send them to fight the [Ottoman
Empire](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"), the soldiers revolted, killing
their officers and several British civilians before troops arriving from Johor
and Burma suppressed the unrest.[59]

After the war, British trade and influence gradually diminished and the
importance of the United States and Japan grew, both located on the
Pacific.[1] The British government devoted significant resources into building
a [naval base](/wiki/Singapore_Naval_Base "Singapore Naval Base") in
Singapore, as a deterrent to the increasingly ambitious [Japanese
Empire](/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan"). Completed in 1939 at a
staggering cost of $500 million, the naval base boasted what was then the
largest [dry dock](/wiki/Dry_dock "Dry dock") in the world, the third-largest
[floating dock](/wiki/Floating_dock_\(jetty\) "Floating dock \(jetty\)"), and
enough fuel tanks to support the entire British navy for six months. It was
defended by heavy 15-inch naval guns and by [Royal Air
Force](/wiki/Royal_Air_Force "Royal Air Force") squadrons stationed at [Tengah
Air Base](/wiki/Tengah_Air_Base "Tengah Air Base"). [Winston
Churchill](/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill") touted it as the
"[Gibraltar](/wiki/Gibraltar "Gibraltar") of the East." Unfortunately, it was
a base without a fleet. The [British Home Fleet](/wiki/British_Home_Fleet
"British Home Fleet") was stationed in Europe and the plan was for it to sail
quickly to Singapore when needed. However, after World War II broke out in
1939, the Fleet was fully occupied with [defending
Britain](/wiki/Battle_of_Britain "Battle of Britain").[60]

Lieutenant General Sir [William George Shedden
Dobbie](/wiki/William_George_Shedden_Dobbie "William George Shedden Dobbie")
was appointed governor of Singapore and [General Officer
Commanding](/wiki/General_Officer_Commanding "General Officer Commanding")
[Malaya Command](/wiki/Malaya_Command "Malaya Command") on 8 November 1935,
holding the post based in [The Istana](/wiki/Istana_\(Singapore\) "Istana
\(Singapore\)") until shortly before the outbreak of [World War
II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") in 1939. He was responsible for forming
[The Dobbie Hypothesis on the fall of
Singapore](/wiki/William_George_Shedden_Dobbie "William George Shedden
Dobbie") which, had it been heeded, may have prevented the fall of Singapore
during the [Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War").
People in Singapore who held German identify papers, including Jews fleeing
the Nazis such as [Karl Duldig](/wiki/Karl_Duldig "Karl Duldig"), [Slawa
Duldig](/wiki/Slawa_Duldig "Slawa Duldig"), and [Eva Duldig](/wiki/Eva_Duldig

colonial government classified them as "citizens of an enemy
country".[63][64][62][65]

## 1942–1945: The Battle for Singapore and Japanese occupation

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=7 "Edit
section: 1942–1945: The Battle for Singapore and Japanese occupation")]

Main articles: [Battle of Singapore](/wiki/Battle_of_Singapore "Battle of
Singapore") and [Japanese occupation of
Singapore](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore "Japanese occupation of
Singapore")

In December 1941, Japan [attacked Pearl Harbor](/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor
"Attack on Pearl Harbor") and the east coast of Malaya, causing the [Pacific
War](/wiki/Pacific_War "Pacific War") to begin in earnest. Both attacks
occurred at the same time, but due to the international dateline, the Honolulu
attack is dated 7 December while the Kota Bharu attack is dated 8 December.
One of Japan's objectives was to capture Southeast Asia and secure the rich
supply of natural resources to feed its military and industry needs.
Singapore, the main Allied base in the region, was an obvious military target
because of its flourishing trade and wealth.[_[citation
needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The British military commanders in Singapore had believed that the Japanese
attack would come by sea from the south since the dense Malayan jungle in the
north would serve as a natural barrier against invasion. Although they had
drawn up a plan for dealing with an attack on northern Malaya, preparations
were never completed. The military was confident that "Fortress Singapore"
would withstand any Japanese attack and this confidence was further reinforced
by the arrival of Force Z, a squadron of British warships dispatched to the
defense of Singapore, including the battleship [HMS  _Prince of
Wales_](/wiki/HMS_Prince_of_Wales_\(53\) "HMS Prince of Wales \(53\)"), and
cruiser [HMS  _Repulse_](/wiki/HMS_Repulse_\(1916\) "HMS Repulse \(1916\)").
The squadron was to have been accompanied by a third capital ship, the
aircraft carrier [HMS  _Indomitable_](/wiki/HMS_Indomitable_\(92\) "HMS
Indomitable \(92\)"), but it ran aground en route, leaving the squadron
without air cover.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed

[Arthur Percival](/wiki/Arthur_Percival "Arthur Percival"), led by a Japanese
officer, marches under a flag of truce to negotiate the capitulation of Allied
forces in Singapore, on 15 February 1942. It was the largest surrender of
British-led forces in history.

On 8 December 1941, Japanese forces landed at [Kota Bharu](/wiki/Kota_Bharu
"Kota Bharu") in northern Malaya. Just two days after the start of [the
invasion of Malaya](/wiki/Battle_of_Malaya "Battle of Malaya"), [_Prince of
Wales_ and _Repulse_ were sunk](/wiki/Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse
"Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse") 50 miles off the coast of
[Kuantan](/wiki/Kuantan "Kuantan") in [Pahang](/wiki/Pahang "Pahang"), by a
force of Japanese bombers and [torpedo bomber](/wiki/Torpedo_bomber "Torpedo
bomber") aircraft, in the worst British naval defeat of World War II. Allied
air support did not arrive in time to protect the two capital ships.[66] After
this incident, Singapore and Malaya suffered daily air raids, including those
targeting civilian structures such as hospitals or shop houses with casualties
ranging from the tens to the hundreds each time.

The Japanese army advanced swiftly southward through the Malay Peninsula,
crushing or bypassing Allied resistance.[67] The Allied forces did not have
tanks, which they considered unsuitable in the [tropical
rainforest](/wiki/Tropical_rainforest "Tropical rainforest"), and their
infantry proved powerless against the Japanese [light
tanks](/wiki/List_of_Japanese_tanks_and_armoured_vehicles_of_the_WWII_period#Light_tanks
"List of Japanese tanks and armoured vehicles of the WWII period"). As their
resistance failed against the Japanese advance, the Allied forces were forced
to retreat southwards towards Singapore. By 31 January 1942, a mere 55 days
after the start of the invasion, the Japanese had conquered the entire Malay
Peninsula and were poised to attack Singapore.[68]

The [causeway](/wiki/Causeway "Causeway") linking Johor and Singapore was
blown up by the Allied forces in an effort to stop the Japanese army. However,
the Japanese managed to cross the [Straits of Johor](/wiki/Straits_of_Johor
"Straits of Johor") in inflatable boats days after. Several fights by the
Allied forces and volunteers of Singapore's population against the advancing
Japanese, such as the [Battle of Pasir Panjang](/wiki/Battle_of_Pasir_Panjang
"Battle of Pasir Panjang"), took place during this period.[69] However, with
most of the defenses shattered and supplies exhausted, Lieutenant-General
[Arthur Percival](/wiki/Arthur_Percival "Arthur Percival") surrendered the
Allied forces in Singapore to General [Tomoyuki
Yamashita](/wiki/Tomoyuki_Yamashita "Tomoyuki Yamashita") of the [Imperial
Japanese Army](/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army "Imperial Japanese Army") on
[Chinese New Year](/wiki/Chinese_New_Year "Chinese New Year"), 15 February
1942. About 130,000 Indian, Australian, and British troops became prisoners of
war, many of whom would later be transported to [Burma](/wiki/Burma_Railway
"Burma Railway"), Japan, Korea, or Manchuria for use as slave labour via
prisoner transports known as "[hell ships](/wiki/Hell_ship "Hell ship")." The
fall of Singapore was the largest surrender of British-led forces in
history.[70] Japanese newspapers triumphantly declared the victory as deciding
the general situation of the war.[71]

Singapore, renamed **Syonan-to** (昭南島 _Shōnan-tō_ , "Bright Southern Island"
in Japanese), was occupied by the Japanese from 1942 to 1945. The Japanese
army imposed harsh measures against the local population, with troops,
especially the _[Kempeitai](/wiki/Kempeitai "Kempeitai")_ or Japanese
[military police](/wiki/Military_police "Military police"), who were
particularly ruthless in dealing with the Chinese population.[72] The most
notable atrocity was the [Sook Ching massacre](/wiki/Sook_Ching_massacre "Sook
Ching massacre") of [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_in_Singapore "Chinese in
Singapore") and Peranakan civilians, undertaken in retaliation against the
support of the [war effort in China](/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War "Second
Sino-Japanese War"). The Japanese screened citizens (including children) to
check if they were "[anti-Japanese](/wiki/Anti-Japanese "Anti-Japanese")". If
so, the "guilty" citizens would be sent away in a truck to be executed. These
mass executions claimed between 25,000 and 50,000 lives in Malaya and
Singapore. The Japanese also launched massive purges against the Indian
community, they secretly killed about 150,000 [Tamil
Indians](/wiki/Indian_Singaporeans "Indian Singaporeans") and tens of
thousands of Malayalam from Malaya, Burma, and Singapore in various places
located near the [Siam Railway](/wiki/Siam_Railway "Siam Railway").[73] The
rest of the population suffered severe hardship throughout the three and a
half years of Japanese occupation.[74] The Malay and Indians were forced to
build the ["Death Railway"](/wiki/Burma_Railway "Burma Railway"), a railway
between Thailand and [Burma](/wiki/Burma "Burma") (Myanmar). Most of them died
while building the railway. First generation Eurasians in Singapore were
interned at the [Sime Road Camp](/wiki/Sime_Road_Camp "Sime Road Camp") while
second generation Eurasians were allowed free in Singapore.[75] Due to their
abilities to speak in local dialects and English, the Japanese were interested
in getting Eurasians to become informers, spies and be part of their
intelligence services.[75] [Mamoru Shinozaki](/wiki/Mamoru_Shinozaki "Mamoru
Shinozaki"), a Japanese official in Singapore, offered some Eurasians to
relocate to [Bahau](/wiki/Bahau "Bahau"), [Negeri
Sembilan](/wiki/Negeri_Sembilan "Negeri Sembilan"), Malaysia.[75] Towards the
end of the war, most Eurasians were arrested and interned at the Sime Road
Camp.[75]

the Chinese identity issues at that time.

After the [Japanese surrender](/wiki/Japanese_surrender "Japanese surrender")
to the Allies on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence
and disorder; [looting](/wiki/Looting "Looting") and revenge-killing were
widespread. British troops led by Lord [Louis
Mountbatten](/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten "Louis Mountbatten"), [Supreme Allied
Commander](/wiki/Supreme_Allied_Commander "Supreme Allied Commander") for
[Southeast Asia Command](/wiki/Southeast_Asia_Command "Southeast Asia
Command"), returned to Singapore to receive the formal surrender of the
Japanese forces in the region from General [Itagaki
Seishiro](/wiki/Itagaki_Seishiro "Itagaki Seishiro") on behalf of General
[Hisaichi Terauchi](/wiki/Hisaichi_Terauchi "Hisaichi Terauchi") on 12
September 1945, and a British Military Administration was formed to govern the
island until March 1946. Much of the infrastructure had been destroyed during
the war, including electricity and water supply systems, telephone services,
as well as the harbor facilities at the [Port of
Singapore](/wiki/Port_of_Singapore "Port of Singapore"). There was also a
shortage of food, leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and
violence. High food prices, unemployment and workers' discontent culminated in
a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and
other services. By late 1947, the economy began to recover, facilitated by a
growing demand for tin and rubber around the world, but it would take several
more years before the economy returned to pre-war levels.[76]

The failure of Britain to defend Singapore had destroyed its credibility as an
infallible ruler in the eyes of Singaporeans. The decades after the war saw a
political awakening amongst the local populace and the rise of [anti-
colonial](/wiki/Anti-colonialism "Anti-colonialism") and nationalist
sentiments, epitomised by the slogan _[Merdeka](/wiki/Merdeka "Merdeka")_ , or
"independence" in the Malay language. The British, on their part, were
prepared to gradually increase [self-governance](/wiki/Self-governance "Self-
governance") for Singapore and Malaya.[76] On 1 April 1946, the [Straits
Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements "Straits Settlements") was dissolved
and Singapore became a separate Crown Colony with a civil administration
headed by a Governor. In July 1947, separate Executive and Legislative
Councils were established and the election of six members of the Legislative
Council was scheduled for the following year.[77]

### 1948–1951: First Legislative Council

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=9 "Edit
section: 1948–1951: First Legislative Council")]

The [first Singaporean elections](/wiki/1948_Singapore_general_election "1948
Singapore general election"), held in March 1948, were limited as only six of
the twenty-five seats on the [Legislative
Council](/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_Singapore "Legislative Council of
Singapore") were to be elected. Only British subjects had the right to vote,
and only 23,000 or about 10% of those eligible registered to vote. Other
members of the council were chosen either by the Governor or by the chambers
of commerce.[76] Three of the elected seats were won by a newly formed
[Singapore Progressive Party](/wiki/Singapore_Progressive_Party "Singapore
Progressive Party") (SPP), a conservative party whose leaders were businessmen
and professionals and were disinclined to press for immediate self-rule. The
other three seats were won by independents.

Three months after the elections, an armed insurgency by communist groups in
Malaya – the [Malayan Emergency](/wiki/Malayan_Emergency "Malayan Emergency")
– broke out. The British imposed tough measures to control [left-
wing](/wiki/Left-wing_politics "Left-wing politics") groups in both Singapore
and Malaya and introduced the controversial [Internal Security
Act](/wiki/Internal_Security_Act_\(Singapore\) "Internal Security Act
\(Singapore\)"), which allowed indefinite detention without trial for persons
suspected of being "threats to security". Since the left-wing groups were the
strongest critics of the colonial system, progress on self-government was
stalled for several years.[76]

### 1951–1955: Second Legislative Council

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=10 "Edit
section: 1951–1955: Second Legislative Council")]

A second Legislative Council election was held in 1951 with the number of
elected seats increased to nine. This election was again dominated by the SPP
which won six seats. While this contributed to the formation of a distinct
local [government of Singapore](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore "Government of
Singapore"), the colonial administration was still dominant. In 1953, with the
communists in Malaya suppressed and the worst of the Emergency over, a British
Commission, headed by [Sir George Rendel](/wiki/George_William_Rendel "George
William Rendel"), proposed a limited form of self-government for Singapore. A
new [Legislative Assembly](/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore
"Legislative Assembly of Singapore") with twenty-five out of thirty-two seats
chosen by popular election would replace the Legislative Council, from which a
[Chief Minister](/wiki/Chief_Minister "Chief Minister") as [head of
government](/wiki/Head_of_government "Head of government") and Council of
Ministers as a cabinet would be picked under a [parliamentary
system](/wiki/Parliamentary_system "Parliamentary system"). The British would
retain control over areas such as internal security and foreign affairs, as
well as veto power over legislation.[_[citation

The election for the Legislative Assembly held on 2 April 1955 was a closely
fought affair, with several new political parties joining the fray. Unlike
previous elections, voters were automatically registered, expanding the
electorate to around 300,000. The SPP was soundly defeated in the election,
winning only four seats. The newly formed, left-leaning [Labour
Front](/wiki/Labour_Front "Labour Front") was the biggest winner with ten
seats and it formed a coalition government with the
[UMNO](/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation "United Malays National
Organisation")-[MCA](/wiki/Malaysian_Chinese_Association "Malaysian Chinese
Association") Alliance, which won three seats.[76] Another new party, the
[People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party "People's Action Party")
(PAP), won three seats.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed

### 1953–1954: The Fajar trial

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=11 "Edit
section: 1953–1954: The Fajar trial")]

The Fajar trial was the first sedition trial in post-war Malaysia and
Singapore. The Fajar was the publication of the [University Socialist
Club](/wiki/University_Socialist_Club "University Socialist Club") which
mainly at that time circulated in the university campus. In May 1954, the
members of the Fajar editorial board were arrested for publishing an allegedly
seditious article named "Aggression in Asia". However, after three days of the
trial, Fajar members were immediately released. The famous English Queen's
Counsel [D. N. Pritt](/wiki/Denis_Pritt "Denis Pritt") acted as the lead
counsel in the case and Lee Kuan Yew who was at that time a young lawyer-
assisted him as the junior counsel. The club's final victory stands out as one
of the notable landmarks in the progress of decolonisation of this part of the
world.[78]

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9e/DavidMarshall.jpg)](/wiki/File:DavidMarshall.jpg)David
Marshall is seen here wearing his political uniform of white bush-jacket,
complete with a hammer.

[David Marshall](/wiki/David_Marshall_\(Singaporean_politician\) "David
Marshall \(Singaporean politician\)"), leader of the Labour Front, became the
first Chief Minister of Singapore. He presided over a shaky government,
receiving little cooperation from both the colonial government and the other
local parties. Social unrest was on the rise, and in May 1955, the [Hock Lee
bus riots](/wiki/Hock_Lee_bus_riots "Hock Lee bus riots") broke out, killing
four people and seriously discrediting Marshall's government.[79] In 1956, the
[Chinese middle school riots](/wiki/Chinese_middle_school_riots "Chinese
middle school riots") broke out among students in [The Chinese High
School](/wiki/The_Chinese_High_School_\(Singapore\) "The Chinese High School
\(Singapore\)") and other schools, further increasing the tension between the
local government and the Chinese students and unionists who were regarded of
having communist sympathies.

In April 1956, Marshall led a delegation to London to negotiate for complete
self-rule in the [Merdeka Talks](/wiki/Merdeka "Merdeka"), but the talks
failed when the British were reluctant to give up control over Singapore's
internal security. The British were concerned about communist influence and
labour strikes which were undermining Singapore's economic stability, and felt
that the local government was ineffective in handling earlier riots. Marshall
resigned following the failure of the talk.

The new Chief Minister, [Lim Yew Hock](/wiki/Lim_Yew_Hock "Lim Yew Hock"),
launched a crackdown on communist and leftist groups, imprisoning many trade
union leaders and several pro-communist members of the PAP under the [Internal
Security Act](/wiki/Internal_Security_Act_\(Singapore\) "Internal Security Act
\(Singapore\)").[80] The British government approved of Lim's tough stance
against communist agitators, and when a new round of talks was held beginning
in March 1957, they agreed to grant complete internal self-government. The
State of Singapore would be created, with its own citizenship. The Legislative
Assembly would be expanded to fifty-one members, entirely chosen by popular
election, and the Prime Minister and cabinet would control all aspects of
government except defense and foreign affairs. The governorship was replaced
by a _[Yang di-Pertuan Negara](/wiki/Yang_di-Pertuan_Negara "Yang di-Pertuan
Negara")_ or [head of state](/wiki/Head_of_state "Head of state"). In August
1958, the State of Singapore Act was passed in the United Kingdom Parliament
providing for the establishment of the State of Singapore.[80]

election") were held in May 1959. The [People's Action
Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party "People's Action Party") (PAP) won the
polls in a landslide victory, winning forty-three of the fifty-one seats. They
accomplished this by courting the Chinese-speaking majority, particularly
those in the labour unions and radical student organizations. Its leader [Lee
Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew "Lee Kuan Yew"), a young Cambridge-educated
lawyer, became the first Prime Minister of Singapore.

The PAP's victory was at first viewed with dismay by foreign and local
business leaders because some party members were pro-communists. Many
businesses promptly shifted their headquarters from Singapore to Kuala
Lumpur.[80] Despite these ill omens, the PAP government embarked on a vigorous
program to address Singapore's various economic and social problems. Economic
development was overseen by the new Minister of Finance [Goh Keng
Swee](/wiki/Goh_Keng_Swee "Goh Keng Swee"), whose strategy was to encourage
foreign and local investment with measures ranging from tax incentives to the
establishment of a large [industrial estate](/wiki/Industrial_estate
"Industrial estate") in [Jurong](/wiki/Jurong "Jurong").[80] The education
system was revamped to train a skilled workforce and the English language was
promoted over the Chinese language as the language of instruction. To
eliminate labour unrest, existing labour unions were consolidated, sometimes
forcibly, into a single umbrella organisation, called the [National Trades
Union Congress](/wiki/National_Trades_Union_Congress "National Trades Union
Congress") (NTUC) with strong oversight from the government. On the social
front, an aggressive and well-funded [public housing
program](/wiki/Housing_and_Development_Board "Housing and Development Board")
was launched to solve the long-standing housing problem. More than 25,000
high-rises, low-cost apartments were constructed during the first two years of
the program.[80]

Despite their successes in governing Singapore, the PAP leaders, including Lee
and Goh, believed that Singapore's future lay with Malaya. They felt that the
historic and economic ties between Singapore and Malaya were too strong for
them to continue as separate nations. Furthermore, Singapore lacked natural
resources and faced both a declining entrepôt trade and a growing population
that required jobs. It was thought that the merger would benefit the economy
by creating a common market, eliminating trade tariffs, and thus supporting
new industries which would solve the ongoing unemployment woes.

Although the PAP leadership campaigned vigorously for a merger, the sizable
pro-communist wing of the PAP was strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a
loss of influence as the ruling party of Malaya, [United Malays National
Organisation](/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation "United Malays
National Organisation"), was staunchly anti-communist and would support the
non-communist faction of PAP against them. The UMNO leaders were also
skeptical of the idea of a merger due to their distrust of the PAP government
and concerns that the large Chinese population in Singapore would alter the
racial balance on which their political power base depended. The issue came to
a head in 1961 when PAP minister [Ong Eng Guan](/wiki/Ong_Eng_Guan "Ong Eng
Guan") defected from the party and beat a PAP candidate in a subsequent by-
election, a move that threatened to bring down Lee's government.

Faced with the prospect of a takeover by the pro-communists, UMNO changed
their minds about the merger. On 27 May, Malaya's Prime Minister, [Tunku Abdul
Rahman](/wiki/Tunku_Abdul_Rahman "Tunku Abdul Rahman"), mooted the idea of a
Federation of [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia "Malaysia"), comprising existing
[Federation of Malaya](/wiki/Federation_of_Malaya "Federation of Malaya"),
Singapore, [Brunei](/wiki/Brunei "Brunei") and the British Borneo territories
of [North Borneo](/wiki/North_Borneo_\(British_Crown_colony\) "North Borneo
\(British Crown colony\)") and
[Sarawak](/wiki/Sarawak_\(British_Crown_colony\) "Sarawak \(British Crown
colony\)"). The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in
the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population.[80] The
British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent
Singapore from becoming a haven for communism. Lee called for a referendum on
the merger, to be held in September 1962, and initiated a vigorous campaign in
advocation of their proposal of merger, possibly aided by the fact that the
government had a large influence over the media.

The referendum did not have an option of objecting to the idea of merger
because no one had raised the issue in the Legislative Assembly before then.
However, the method of merger had been debated, by the PAP, Singapore People's
Alliance and the Barisian Sosialis, each with their own proposals. The
referendum was called therefore, was to resolve this issue.

The referendum called had three options. Singapore could join Malaysia, but
would be granted full autonomy and only with fulfilment of conditions to
guarantee that, which was option A. The second option, option B, called for
full integration into Malaysia without such autonomy, with the status of any
other state in Malaysia. The third option, option C, was to enter Malaysia "on
terms no less favourable than the Borneo territories", noting the motive of
why Malaysia proposed the Borneo territories to join as well. After the
referendum was held, the option A received 70% of the votes in the referendum,
with 26% of the ballots left blank as advocated by the Barisan Sosialis to
protest against option A. The other two plans received less than two percent
each.

On 9 July 1963, the leaders of Singapore, Malaya, Sabah and Sarawak signed the
[Malaysia Agreement](/wiki/Malaysia_Agreement "Malaysia Agreement") to
establish Malaysia which was planned to come into being on 31 August.
Nonetheless, on 31 August (the original Malaysia Day), Lee Kuan Yew stood in
front of a crowd at the Padang in Singapore and unilaterally declared
Singapore's independence.[81] On 31 August, Singapore declared its
independence from the United Kingdom, with Yusof bin Ishak as the head of
state (Yang di-Pertuan Negara) and Lee Kuan Yew as prime minister. However it
was postponed by Tunku Abdul Rahman to 16 September 1963, to accommodate a
United Nations mission to North Borneo and Sarawak to ensure that they really
wanted a merger, which was prompted by Indonesian objections to the formation
of Malaysia. On 16 September 1963, coincidentally Lee's fortieth birthday, he
once again stood in front of a crowd at the Padang and this time proclaimed
Singapore as part of Malaysia.[82] Pledging his loyalty to the Central
Government, the Tunku and his colleagues, Lee asked for 'an honourable
relationship between the states and the Central Government, a relationship
between brothers, and not a relationship between masters and servants

### Merger

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=17 "Edit
section: Merger")]

On 16 September 1963, Malaya, Singapore, [North
Borneo](/wiki/Crown_Colony_of_North_Borneo "Crown Colony of North Borneo") and
[Sarawak](/wiki/Crown_Colony_of_Sarawak "Crown Colony of Sarawak") were merged
and Malaysia was formed.[80] The union was rocky from the start. During the
[1963 Singapore state elections](/wiki/1963_Singapore_general_election "1963
Singapore general election"), a local branch of [United Malays National
Organisation](/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation "United Malays
National Organisation") (UMNO) took part in the election despite an earlier
UMNO's agreement with the PAP not to participate in the state's politics
during Malaysia's formative years. Although UMNO lost all its bids, relations
between PAP and UMNO worsened. The PAP, in a tit-for-tat, challenged UMNO
candidates in the 1964 federal election as part of the [Malaysian Solidarity
Convention](/wiki/Malaysian_Solidarity_Convention "Malaysian Solidarity
Convention"), winning one seat in the Malaysian Parliament.

### Racial tension

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=18 "Edit
section: Racial tension")]

Racial tensions increased as ethnic Chinese and other non-Malay ethnic groups
in Singapore rejected the discriminatory policies imposed by the Malays such
as quotas for the Malays as [special privileges were granted to the
Malays](/wiki/Ketuanan_Melayu "Ketuanan Melayu") guaranteed under [Article 153
of the Constitution of
Malaysia](/wiki/Article_153_of_the_Constitution_of_Malaysia "Article 153 of
the Constitution of Malaysia"). There were also other financial and economic
benefits that were preferentially given to Malays. Lee Kuan Yew and other
political leaders began advocating for the fair and equal treatment of all
races in Malaysia, with a rallying cry of _"[Malaysian
Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysian_Malaysia "Malaysian Malaysia")!"_.

Meanwhile, the Malays in Singapore were being increasingly incited by the
federal government's accusations that the PAP was mistreating the Malays. The
external political situation was also tense; [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesia
"Indonesia") President [Sukarno](/wiki/Sukarno "Sukarno") declared a state of
_[Konfrontasi](/wiki/Indonesia-Malaysia_confrontation "Indonesia-Malaysia
confrontation")_ (Confrontation) against Malaysia and initiated military and
other actions against the new nation, including the [bombing of MacDonald
House](/wiki/MacDonald_House_bombing "MacDonald House bombing") in Singapore
10 March 1965 by Indonesian commandos, killing three people.[83] Indonesia
also conducted sedition activities to provoke the Malays against the
Chinese.[80] The most notorious riots were the [1964 Race
Riots](/wiki/1964_Race_Riots "1964 Race Riots") that first took place on
Prophet [Muhammad](/wiki/Muhammad "Muhammad")'s birthday on 21 July with
twenty-three people killed and hundreds injured, and also, many people by then
still hated the rest. During the unrest, the price of food skyrocketed when
the transport system was disrupted, causing further hardship for the people.

The state and federal governments also had conflicts on the economic front.
UMNO leaders feared that the economic dominance of Singapore would inevitably
shift political power away from [Kuala Lumpur](/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur "Kuala
Lumpur"). Despite earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore
continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In
retaliation, Singapore refused to provide Sabah and Sarawak the full extent of
the loans previously agreed to for the economic development of the two eastern
states.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation
needed")_] The [Bank of China](/wiki/Bank_of_China "Bank of China") branch of
Singapore was closed by the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur as it was
suspected of funding communists. The situation escalated to such an extent
that talks between UMNO and the PAP broke down, and abusive speeches and
writings became rife on both sides. UMNO extremists called for the arrest of
[Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew "Lee Kuan Yew").

### Separation

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=19 "Edit
section: Separation")]

Seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed, the Malaysian Prime Minister
[Tunku Abdul Rahman](/wiki/Tunku_Abdul_Rahman "Tunku Abdul Rahman") decided to
expel Singapore from the federation. [Goh Keng Swee](/wiki/Goh_Keng_Swee "Goh
Keng Swee"), who had become skeptical of the merger's economic benefits for
Singapore, convinced Lee Kuan Yew that the separation had to take place. UMNO
and PAP representatives worked out the terms of separation in extreme secrecy
in order to present the British government, in particular, with a _fait
accompli_.[84][85][86]

On 9 August 1965, the Parliament of Malaysia voted 126–0 in favor of a
constitutional amendment expelling Singapore from the federation. A tearful
Lee Kuan Yew announced in a televised press conference that Singapore had
become a sovereign, independent nation. In a widely remembered quote, he
stated: "For me, it is a moment of anguish because all my life.... you see,
the whole of my adult life.... I have believed in merger and the unity of
these two territories. You know, it's a people, connected by geography,
economics, and ties of kinship...."[87][88] The new state became the Republic
of Singapore, with [Yusof bin Ishak](/wiki/Yusof_bin_Ishak "Yusof bin Ishak")
appointed as its first [President](/wiki/President_of_Singapore "President of
Singapore").[89]

Soon_Lee_Bus_Park_and_Jurong_Industrial_Estate_aerial_view.jpg)](/wiki/File:Soon_Lee_Bus_Park_and_Jurong_Industrial_Estate_aerial_view.jpg)The
[Jurong](/wiki/Jurong "Jurong") Industrial Estate was developed in the 1960s
to industrialise the economy.

After gaining independence abruptly, Singapore faced a future filled with
uncertainties. The [Konfrontasi](/wiki/Konfrontasi "Konfrontasi") was on-going
and the conservative UMNO faction strongly opposed the separation; Singapore
faced the dangers of attack by the Indonesian military and forcible re-
integration into the Malaysia Federation on unfavorable terms. Much of the
international media was skeptical of prospects for Singapore's survival.
Besides the issue of sovereignty, the pressing problems were unemployment,
housing, education, and the lack of [natural resources](/wiki/Natural_resource
"Natural resource") and land.[90] Unemployment was ranging between 10 and 12%,
threatening to trigger civil unrest.

Singapore immediately sought international recognition of its sovereignty. The
new state joined the United Nations on 21 September 1965, becoming the 117th
member; and joined the [Commonwealth](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations
"Commonwealth of Nations") in October that year. Foreign minister [Sinnathamby
Rajaratnam](/wiki/Sinnathamby_Rajaratnam "Sinnathamby Rajaratnam") headed a
new foreign service that helped assert Singapore's independence and
establishing diplomatic relations with other countries.[91] On 22 December
1965, the Constitution Amendment Act was passed under which the Head of State
became the President and the State of Singapore became the Republic of
Singapore. Singapore later co-founded the [Association of Southeast Asian
Nations](/wiki/Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations "Association of
Southeast Asian Nations") (ASEAN) on 8 August 1967 and was admitted into the
[Non-Aligned Movement](/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement "Non-Aligned Movement") in
1970.[92]

The [Economic Development Board](/wiki/Economic_Development_Board "Economic
Development Board") had been set up in 1961 to formulate and implement
national economic strategies, focusing on promoting Singapore's manufacturing
sector.[93] [Industrial estates](/wiki/Industrial_estate "Industrial estate")
were set up, especially in [Jurong](/wiki/Jurong "Jurong"), and foreign
investment was attracted to the country with tax incentives. The
industrialization transformed the manufacturing sector to one that produced
higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The [service
industry](/wiki/Service_industry "Service industry") also grew at this time,
driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing
commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore
also attracted big oil companies like [Shell](/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell "Royal
Dutch Shell") and [Esso](/wiki/Esso "Esso") to establish oil refineries in
Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third-largest oil-refining
centre in the world.[90] The government invested heavily in an education
system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised
practical training to develop a competent workforce well suited for the
industry.

The lack of good public housing, poor sanitation, and high unemployment led to
social problems from crime to health issues. The proliferation of
[squatter](/wiki/Squatter "Squatter") settlements resulted in safety hazards
and caused the [Bukit Ho Swee Fire](/wiki/Bukit_Ho_Swee_Fire "Bukit Ho Swee
Fire") in 1961 that killed four people and left 16,000 others homeless.[94]
The [Housing Development Board](/wiki/Housing_Development_Board "Housing
Development Board") set up before independence continued to be largely
successful and huge building projects sprung up to provide affordable public
housing to resettle the squatters. Within a decade, the majority of the
population had been housed in these apartments. The [Central Provident
Fund](/wiki/Central_Provident_Fund "Central Provident Fund") (CPF) Housing
Scheme, introduced in 1968, allows residents to use their compulsory savings
account to purchase HDB flats and gradually increases home-ownership in
Singapore.[95]

British troops had remained in Singapore following its independence, but in
1968, London announced its decision to withdraw the forces by 1971.[96] With
the secret aid of military advisers from [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel"),
Singapore rapidly established the [Singapore Armed
Forces](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces "Singapore Armed Forces"), with the help
of a [national service](/wiki/National_Service_in_Singapore "National Service
in Singapore") program introduced in 1967.[97] Since independence, Singaporean
defense spending has been approximately five percent of GDP.[_[citation

Batok Estate. Large scale public housing development has created high housing
ownership among the population.

Further economic success continued through the 1980s, with the unemployment
rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% up until 1999.
During the 1980s, Singapore began to upgrade to higher-technological
industries, such as the [wafer fabrication](/wiki/Wafer_fabrication "Wafer
fabrication") sector, in order to compete with its neighbours which now had
cheaper labour. [Singapore Changi Airport](/wiki/Singapore_Changi_Airport
"Singapore Changi Airport") was opened in 1981 and [Singapore
Airlines](/wiki/Singapore_Airlines "Singapore Airlines") was developed to
become a major airline.[98] The [Port of Singapore](/wiki/Port_of_Singapore
"Port of Singapore") became one of the world's busiest ports and the service
and tourism industries also grew immensely during this period. Singapore
emerged as an important transportation hub and a major tourist
destination.[99]

The [Housing Development Board](/wiki/Housing_Development_Board "Housing
Development Board") (HDB) continued to promote public housing with new towns,
such as [Ang Mo Kio](/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio "Ang Mo Kio"), being designed and built.
These new residential estates have larger and higher-standard apartments and
are served with better amenities. Today, 80–90% of the population lives in HDB
apartments. In 1987, the first [Mass Rapid
Transit](/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_\(Singapore\) "Mass Rapid Transit
\(Singapore\)") (MRT) line began operation, connecting most of these housing
estates and the city centre.[100]

The political situation in Singapore continues to be dominated by the
[People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party "People's Action
Party"). The PAP won all the parliamentary seats in every election between
1966 and 1981.[101] The PAP rule is termed
[authoritarian](/wiki/Authoritarianism "Authoritarianism") by some activists
and opposition politicians who see the strict regulation of political and
media activities by the government as an infringement on political
rights.[102] The conviction of opposition politician [Chee Soon
Juan](/wiki/Chee_Soon_Juan "Chee Soon Juan") for illegal protests and the
defamation lawsuits against [J.B. Jeyaretnam](/wiki/Joshua_Benjamin_Jeyaretnam
"Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam") have been cited by the opposition parties as
examples of such authoritarianism.[103] The lack of [separation of
powers](/wiki/Separation_of_powers_in_Singapore "Separation of powers in
Singapore") between the court system and the government led to further
accusations by the opposition parties of [miscarriage of
justice](/wiki/Miscarriage_of_justice "Miscarriage of justice").[_[citation
needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The [government of Singapore](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore "Government of
Singapore") underwent several significant changes. [Non-Constituency Members
of Parliament](/wiki/Non-Constituency_Members_of_Parliament "Non-Constituency
Members of Parliament") were introduced in 1984 to allow up to three losing
candidates from opposition parties to be appointed as MPs. [Group
Representation Constituencies](/wiki/Group_Representation_Constituencies
"Group Representation Constituencies") (GRCs) was introduced in 1988 to create
multi-seat electoral divisions, intended to ensure minority representation in
parliament.[104] [Nominated Members of
Parliament](/wiki/Nominated_Members_of_Parliament "Nominated Members of
Parliament") were introduced in 1990 to allow non-elected non-partisan
MPs.[105] The [Constitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_Singapore "Constitution of
Singapore") was amended in 1991 to provide for an [Elected
President](/wiki/President_of_Singapore "President of Singapore") who has veto
power in the use of national reserves and appointments to public office.[106]
The opposition parties have complained that the GRC system has made it
difficult for them to gain a foothold in [parliamentary elections in
Singapore](/wiki/Parliamentary_elections_in_Singapore "Parliamentary elections
in Singapore"), and the [plurality voting
system](/wiki/Plurality_voting_system "Plurality voting system") tends to
exclude minority parties.[107]

In 1990, [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew "Lee Kuan Yew") passed the reins of
[leadership](/wiki/Leadership "Leadership") to [Goh Chok
Tong](/wiki/Goh_Chok_Tong "Goh Chok Tong"), who became the second prime
minister of Singapore. Goh presented a more open and consultative style of
leadership as the country continued to modernise. In 1997, Singapore
experienced the effect of the [Asian financial
crisis](/wiki/Asian_financial_crisis "Asian financial crisis") and tough
measures, such as cuts in the CPF contribution, were implemented.[_[citation
needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Lee's programs in Singapore had a profound effect on the Communist leadership
in China, who made a major effort, especially under [Deng
Xiaoping](/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping "Deng Xiaoping"), to emulate his policies of
economic growth, entrepreneurship, and subtle suppression of dissent. Over
22,000 Chinese officials were sent to Singapore to study its methods.[108]

Singapore went through some of its most post-war crises in the early 21st
century, such as [embassies attack plot](/wiki/Singapore_embassies_attack_plot
"Singapore embassies attack plot") in 2001,[109] [SARS
outbreak](/wiki/2002-2004_SARS_outbreak "2002-2004 SARS outbreak") in
2003,[110] [H1N1 pandemic](/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic_in_Asia#Singapore

pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Singapore "COVID-19 pandemic in
Singapore") in between January 2020 and 2023.[112]

More emphasis was placed on promoting social integration and trust between the
different communities.[113] There are also increasing reforms in the
[Education](/wiki/Education "Education") system. [Primary
education](/wiki/Primary_education "Primary education") was made
[compulsory](/wiki/Compulsory_education "Compulsory education") in 2003.[114]

In 2004, then Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore [Lee Hsien
Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong "Lee Hsien Loong"), the eldest son of [Lee Kuan
Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew "Lee Kuan Yew"), took over from incumbent [Goh Chok
Tong](/wiki/Goh_Chok_Tong "Goh Chok Tong") and became the third prime minister
of Singapore.[115] He introduced several policy changes, including the
reduction of [national service](/wiki/National_Service_in_Singapore "National
Service in Singapore") duration from two and a half years to two years, and
the [legalisation of casino gambling](/wiki/Integrated_Resort "Integrated

reestablishment of the [Singapore Grand Prix](/wiki/Singapore_Grand_Prix
"Singapore Grand Prix") in 2008,[117] and the hosting of the [2010 Summer
Youth Olympics](/wiki/2010_Summer_Youth_Olympics "2010 Summer Youth
Olympics").[118]

The [general election of 2006](/wiki/2006_Singapore_general_election "2006
Singapore general election") was a landmark election because of the prominent
use of the internet and blogging to cover and comment on the election,
circumventing the official media.[119] The PAP retained power, winning 82 of
the 84 parliamentary seats and 66% of the votes.[120]

On 3 June 2009, Singapore commemorated 50 years of [self-
governance](/wiki/Self-governance_of_Singapore "Self-governance of
Singapore").[121]

Singapore's move to increase attractiveness as a tourist destination was
further boosted in March 2010 with the opening of [Universal Studios
Singapore](/wiki/Universal_Studios_Singapore "Universal Studios Singapore") at
Resorts World Sentosa.[122] In the same year, [Marina Bay

Singapore's economy grew by 14.7% for the whole year, the best growth on
record ever for the country.[124]

The [general election of 2011](/wiki/2011_Singapore_general_election "2011

first time a [Group Representation

[Workers' Party](/wiki/Workers%27_Party_\(Singapore\) "Workers' Party
\(Singapore\)").[125] The final results saw a 6.46% swing against the PAP from
the 2006 elections to 60.14%, its lowest since independence.[126]
Nevertheless, PAP won 81 out of 87 seats and maintained its parliamentary
majority.[127]

[Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew "Lee Kuan Yew"), founding father and the
first Prime Minister of Singapore, died on 23 March 2015. Singapore declared a
period of national mourning from 23 to 29 March.[128] Lee Kuan Yew was
accorded a state funeral.[129]

skyline following the conclusion of the 2015 National Day Parade on 9 August
2015.

The year 2015 also saw Singapore celebrate its Golden Jubilee of 50 years of
independence. An extra day of the holiday, 7 August 2015, was declared to
celebrate Singapore's Golden Jubilee. Fun packs, which are usually given to
people who attend the National Day Parade were given to every Singaporean and
PR household. In commemoration of the significant milestone, the 2015 National
Day Parade was the first-ever parade to be held both at the Padang and the
Float at Marina Bay. NDP 2015 was the first National Day Parade without the
founding leader [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew "Lee Kuan Yew"), who never
missed a single National Day Parade since 1966.[130]

The [2015 general elections](/wiki/2015_Singaporean_general_election "2015
Singaporean general election") was held on 11 September shortly after the 2015
National Day Parade. The election was the first since [Singapore's
independence](/wiki/Independence_of_Singapore "Independence of Singapore")
which saw all seats contested.[131] The election was also the first after the
[death of Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Death_of_Lee_Kuan_Yew "Death of Lee Kuan Yew")
(the nation's first Prime Minister and an
[MP](/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar_Group_Representation_Constituency "Tanjong Pagar
Group Representation Constituency") until his passing). The ruling party PAP
received its best results [since 2001](/wiki/2001_Singaporean_general_election
"2001 Singaporean general election") with 69.86% of the popular vote, an
increase of 9.72% from the [previous election in
2011](/wiki/2011_Singaporean_general_election "2011 Singaporean general
election").[132]

Following amendments to the [Constitution of
Singapore](/wiki/Constitution_of_Singapore "Constitution of Singapore"),
Singapore held its first reserved [presidential elections in
2017](/wiki/2017_Singaporean_presidential_election "2017 Singaporean
presidential election"). The election was the first to be reserved for a
particular racial group under a hiatus-triggered model. The 2017 election was
reserved for candidates from the minority [Malay
community](/wiki/Malay_Singaporeans "Malay Singaporeans").[133] Then Speaker
of Parliament [Halimah Yacob](/wiki/Halimah_Yacob "Halimah Yacob") won the
elections though a [walkover](/wiki/Walkover "Walkover") and was inaugurated
as the eighth President of Singapore on 14 September 2017, becoming the first
female President of Singapore.[134]

In July 2020, the ruling party, The People's Action Party (PAP), won 83 out of
93 seats and 61.2% of the popular vote in the [general
election](/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election "2020 Singaporean general
election"), meaning PAP won its 13th consecutive general election since
Singapore's independence. However, the result was a significant decline from
the 2015 election.[135]
