**[Second Sino-Japanese War](/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War "Second Sino-
Japanese War")**  
  
The **fall of Singapore** , also known as the **Battle of Singapore** ,[c]
took place in the [South–East Asian theatre](/wiki/South-
East_Asian_theatre_of_World_War_II "South-East Asian theatre of World War II")
of the [Pacific War](/wiki/Pacific_War "Pacific War"). The [Japanese
Empire](/wiki/Japanese_Empire "Japanese Empire") captured the British
stronghold of [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements
"Singapore in the Straits Settlements"), with fighting lasting from 8 to 15
February 1942. Singapore was the foremost British military base and economic
port in [South–East Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia "Southeast Asia") and had been
of great importance to British interwar defence
[strategy](/wiki/Singapore_strategy "Singapore strategy"). The capture of
Singapore resulted in the largest British surrender in its history.

Before the battle, Japanese General [Tomoyuki
Yamashita](/wiki/Tomoyuki_Yamashita "Tomoyuki Yamashita") had advanced with
approximately 30,000 men down the Malayan Peninsula in the [Malayan
campaign](/wiki/Malayan_campaign "Malayan campaign"). The British erroneously
considered the jungle terrain impassable, leading to a swift Japanese advance
as Allied defences were quickly outflanked. The British Lieutenant-General,
[Arthur Percival](/wiki/Arthur_Percival "Arthur Percival"), commanded 85,000
Allied troops at Singapore, although many units were under-strength and most
units lacked experience. The British outnumbered the Japanese but much of the
water for the island was drawn from reservoirs on the mainland. The British
destroyed [the causeway](/wiki/Johor%E2%80%93Singapore_Causeway
"Johor–Singapore Causeway"), forcing the Japanese into an improvised crossing
of the [Johore Strait](/wiki/Straits_of_Johor "Straits of Johor"). Singapore
was considered so important that Prime Minister [Winston
Churchill](/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill") ordered Percival to
fight to the last man.

The Japanese attacked the weakest part of the island defences and established
a [beachhead](/wiki/Beachhead "Beachhead") on 8 February. Percival had
expected a crossing in the north and failed to reinforce the defenders in
time. Communication and leadership failures beset the Allies and there were
few defensive positions or reserves near the beachhead. The Japanese advance
continued and the Allies began to run out of supplies. By 15 February, about a
million civilians in the city were crammed into the remaining area held by
Allied forces, 1 percent of the island. Japanese aircraft continuously bombed
the civilian water supply which was expected to fail within days. The Japanese
were also almost at the end of their supplies and Yamashita wanted to avoid
costly [house-to-house fighting](/wiki/Urban_warfare "Urban warfare").

For the second time since the battle began, Yamashita demanded [unconditional
surrender](/wiki/Unconditional_surrender "Unconditional surrender") and on the
afternoon of 15 February, Percival capitulated. About 80,000 British,
[Indian](/wiki/British_Raj "British Raj"), Australian and local troops became
[prisoners of war](/wiki/Prisoner_of_war "Prisoner of war"), joining the
50,000 taken in Malaya; many died of neglect, abuse or [forced
labour](/wiki/Forced_labour "Forced labour"). Three days after the British
surrender, the Japanese began the [Sook Ching](/wiki/Sook_Ching "Sook Ching")
purge, killing thousands of civilians. The Japanese held Singapore until the
end of the war. About 40,000, mostly conscripted, Indian soldiers joined the
[Indian National Army](/wiki/Indian_National_Army "Indian National Army") and
fought with the Japanese in the [Burma campaign](/wiki/Burma_campaign "Burma
campaign"). Churchill called it the worst [disaster](/wiki/Military_disaster
"Military disaster") in [British military
history](/wiki/Military_history_of_the_United_Kingdom "Military history of the
United Kingdom"). The fall of Singapore, the [sinking of _Prince of Wales_ and
_Repulse_](/wiki/Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse "Sinking of Prince of
Wales and Repulse"), and other defeats in 1941–42 all severely undermined
British prestige, which contributed to the end of British colonial rule in the
region after the war.

See also: [Second Sino-Japanese War](/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War "Second
Sino-Japanese War")

In the interwar years, Britain had established a naval base in Singapore after
the [Anglo-Japanese alliance](/wiki/Anglo-Japanese_Alliance "Anglo-Japanese
Alliance") had lapsed in 1923. As part of the [Singapore
strategy](/wiki/Singapore_strategy "Singapore strategy"), the base formed a
key part of British interwar defence planning for the region. Financial
constraints had hampered construction efforts during the intervening period
and shifting strategic circumstances had largely undermined the key premises
behind the strategy by the time war had broken out in the Pacific.[6][7]
During 1940 and 1941, the Allies imposed a trade [embargo](/wiki/Embargo
"Embargo") on Japan in response to its campaigns in
[China](/wiki/Republic_of_China_\(1912%E2%80%931949\) "Republic of China
\(1912–1949\)") and its occupation of [French
Indochina](/wiki/French_Indochina "French Indochina").[8][9] The basic plan
for taking Singapore was worked out in July 1940. Intelligence gained in late
1940–early 1941 did not alter that plan but confirmed it in the minds of
Japanese decision makers.[10] On 11 November 1940, the German raider
_[Atlantis](/wiki/German_auxiliary_cruiser_Atlantis "German auxiliary cruiser
Atlantis")_ captured the British steamer [_Automedon_](/wiki/SS_Automedon "SS
Automedon") in the [Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean"), carrying
papers meant for Air Marshal Sir [Robert Brooke-Popham](/wiki/Robert_Brooke-
Popham "Robert Brooke-Popham"), the British commander in the Far East. The
papers included information about the weakness of the Singapore base. In
December 1940, the Germans handed over copies of the papers to the Japanese.
The Japanese had broken the British Army's codes and in January 1941, the
Second Department (the intelligence-gathering arm) of the Imperial Army
interpreted and read a message from Singapore to London complaining in much
detail about the weak state of "Fortress Singapore", a message so frank in its
admission of weakness that the Japanese at first suspected it was a British
plant, believing that no officer would be so open in admitting weaknesses to
his superiors. Only after cross-checking the message with the _Automedon_
papers did the Japanese accept it to be genuine.[11]

Japanese oil reserves were rapidly being depleted because of its military
operations in China and by industrial consumption. In the latter half of 1941,
the Japanese began preparations for war to seize vital resources if peaceful
efforts to buy them failed. Planners determined a broad scheme of manoeuvres
that incorporated simultaneous attacks on the territories of Britain, The
Netherlands and the United States. This would see landings in Malaya and Hong
Kong as part of a general move south to secure Singapore, connected to Malaya
by the [Johor–Singapore Causeway](/wiki/Johor%E2%80%93Singapore_Causeway
"Johor–Singapore Causeway") and then an invasion of the oil-rich area of
Borneo and Java in the [Dutch East Indies](/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies "Dutch East
Indies"). Attacks would be made against the American naval fleet at Pearl
Harbor as well as landings in the Philippines and attacks on Guam, Wake Island
and the Gilbert Islands.[12][13] Following these attacks, a period of
consolidation was planned, after which the Japanese planners intended to build
up the defences of the captured territory by establishing a strong perimeter
from the India–Burma frontier through to Wake Island and traversing Malaya,
the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea and New Britain, the Bismarck Archipelago,
and the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. This perimeter would be used to block
Allied attempts to regain the lost territory and defeat their will to
fight.[12]

\(Japan\)") invaded Malaya from Indochina, moving into northern Malaya and
[Thailand](/wiki/Thailand "Thailand") by [amphibious
assault](/wiki/Amphibious_warfare "Amphibious warfare") on 8 December
1941.[14][15] This was virtually simultaneous with the Japanese [attack on
Pearl Harbor](/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor "Attack on Pearl Harbor") which
precipitated the United States' entry into the war. Thailand resisted landings
on its territory for about 5 to 8 hours; it then signed a ceasefire and a
Treaty of Friendship with Japan, later declaring war on the UK and the US. The
Japanese then proceeded overland across the Thai–Malayan border to attack
Malaya. At this time, the Japanese began [bombing
Singapore](/wiki/Bombing_of_Singapore_\(1941\) "Bombing of Singapore
\(1941\)").[16]

The 25th Army was resisted in northern Malaya by [III
Corps](/wiki/III_Corps_\(India\) "III Corps \(India\)") of the [British Indian
Army](/wiki/British_Indian_Army "British Indian Army"). Although the 25th Army
was outnumbered by Commonwealth forces in Malaya and Singapore, they did not
take the initiative with their forces while Japanese commanders concentrated
theirs. The Japanese were superior in [close air
support](/wiki/Close_air_support "Close air support"), armour, co-ordination,
tactics and experience. Conventional British military thinking was that the
Japanese forces were inferior and characterised the Malayan jungles as
"impassable"; the Japanese were repeatedly able to use this to their advantage
to outflank hastily established defensive lines.[17][18] Prior to the Battle
of Singapore the most resistance was met at the [Battle of
Muar](/wiki/Battle_of_Muar "Battle of Muar") which involved the [8th
Australian Division](/wiki/8th_Division_\(Australia\) "8th Division
\(Australia\)") and the 45th Indian Brigade. The British troops left in the
city of Singapore were basically garrison troops.[19][20]

At the start of the campaign, the Commonwealth forces had only 164 first-line
aircraft in Malaya and Singapore and the only fighter type was the sub-
standard [Brewster 339E Buffalo](/wiki/Brewster_F2A_Buffalo "Brewster F2A
Buffalo"). The Buffaloes were operated by one [Royal New Zealand Air
Force](/wiki/Royal_New_Zealand_Air_Force "Royal New Zealand Air Force")
(RNZAF), two [Royal Australian Air Force](/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force
"Royal Australian Air Force") (RAAF), and two [Royal Air
Force](/wiki/Royal_Air_Force "Royal Air Force") (RAF) squadrons.[21] The
aircraft were, according to historian Peter Dennis, "not considered good
enough for use in Europe" and major shortcomings included a slow rate of climb
and the fuel system, which required the pilot to hand-pump fuel if flying
above 6,000 ft (1,800 m).[22] The [Imperial Japanese Army Air
Force](/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army_Air_Force "Imperial Japanese Army Air
Force") was more numerous and better trained than the second-hand assortment
of untrained pilots and inferior Commonwealth equipment remaining in Malaya,
Borneo and Singapore. Japanese fighters were superior to the Commonwealth
fighters, which helped the Japanese to gain [air
supremacy](/wiki/Air_supremacy "Air supremacy").[23] Although outnumbered and
outclassed, the Buffalos were able to provide some resistance, with RAAF
pilots alone managing to shoot down at least 20 Japanese aircraft before the
few survivors were withdrawn.[22]

[battleship](/wiki/Battleship "Battleship") [HMS  _Prince of
Wales_](/wiki/HMS_Prince_of_Wales_\(53\) "HMS Prince of Wales \(53\)"), the
[battlecruiser](/wiki/Battlecruiser "Battlecruiser") [HMS
_Repulse_](/wiki/HMS_Repulse_\(1916\) "HMS Repulse \(1916\)") and four
[destroyers](/wiki/Destroyer "Destroyer"), sailed north out of Singapore on 8
December to oppose expected Japanese landings along the coast of Malaya.
Japanese land-based aircraft found and sank the two capital
[ships](/wiki/Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse "Sinking of Prince of
Wales and Repulse") on 10 December,[24] leaving the east coast of the Malayan
Peninsula exposed and allowing the Japanese to continue their amphibious
landings. Japanese forces quickly isolated, surrounded and forced the
surrender of Indian units defending the coast. Despite their numerical
inferiority, they advanced down the Malayan Peninsula, overwhelming the
defences. The Japanese forces also used [bicycle
infantry](/wiki/Bicycle_infantry "Bicycle infantry") and [light
tanks](/wiki/Light_tank "Light tank"), allowing swift movement through the
jungle. The Commonwealth having thought the terrain made them impractical, had
no tanks and only a few armoured vehicles, which put them at a severe
disadvantage.[25]

Although more Commonwealth units—including some from the 8th Australian
Division—joined the campaign, the Japanese prevented them from regrouping.[d]
The Japanese overran cities and advanced toward Singapore, which was an anchor
for the operations of the [American-British-Dutch-Australian
Command](/wiki/American-British-Dutch-Australian_Command "American-British-
Dutch-Australian Command") (ABDACOM), the first Allied joint command of the
Second World War. Singapore controlled the main shipping channel between the
Indian and the Pacific Oceans. An ambush was sprung by the [2/30th Australian
Battalion](/wiki/2/30th_Battalion_\(Australia\) "2/30th Battalion
\(Australia\)") on the main road at the Gemenceh River near Gemas on 14
January, causing many Japanese casualties.[27][e]

At Bakri, from 18 to 22 January, the Australian
[2/19th](/wiki/2/19th_Battalion_\(Australia\) "2/19th Battalion
\(Australia\)") and [2/29th battalions](/wiki/2/29th_Battalion_\(Australia\)
"2/29th Battalion \(Australia\)") and the [45th Indian
Brigade](/wiki/45th_Indian_Infantry_Brigade "45th Indian Infantry Brigade")
(Lieutenant Colonel [Charles Anderson](/wiki/Charles_Groves_Wright_Anderson
"Charles Groves Wright Anderson")) repeatedly fought through Japanese
positions before running out of ammunition near Parit Sulong. The survivors
were forced to leave behind about 110 Australian and 40 Indian wounded, who
were later beaten, tortured and murdered by Japanese troops during the [Parit
Sulong Massacre](/wiki/Parit_Sulong_Massacre "Parit Sulong Massacre").[29] Of
over 3,000 men from these units only around 500 men escaped. For his
leadership in the fighting withdrawal, Anderson was awarded the [Victoria
Cross](/wiki/Victoria_Cross "Victoria Cross").[30][31] A determined counter-
attack by the 5/11th Sikh Regiment (Lieutenant-Colonel John Parkin) in the
area of Niyor, near Kluang, on 25 January and an ambush around the Nithsdale
Estate by the [2/18th Australian
Battalion](/wiki/2/18th_Battalion_\(Australia\) "2/18th Battalion
\(Australia\)") on 26/27 January bought valuable time and permitted East
Force, based on the [22nd Australian Brigade](/wiki/22nd_Brigade_\(Australia\)
"22nd Brigade \(Australia\)") (Brigadier [Harold
Taylor](/wiki/Harold_Burfield_Taylor "Harold Burfield Taylor")), to withdraw
from eastern [Johor](/wiki/Johor "Johor") (formerly Johore).[32][33][34] On 31
January, the last Commonwealth forces crossed the causeway linking Johor and
Singapore and engineers blew it up.[35][36]

## Prelude

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fall_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=4 "Edit
section: Prelude")]

During the weeks preceding the invasion, Commonwealth forces suffered a number
of both subdued and openly disruptive disagreements amongst its senior
commanders,[37] as well as pressure from Australian Prime Minister [John
Curtin](/wiki/John_Curtin "John Curtin").[38] Lieutenant-General [Arthur
Percival](/wiki/Arthur_Percival "Arthur Percival"), commander of the garrison,
had 85,000 soldiers—the equivalent, on paper at least, of just over four
divisions.[39][f] Of this figure, 15,000 men were employed in supply,
administrative, or other non-combatant roles. The remaining force was a mix of
front-line and second-line troops. There were 49 infantry battalions—21
Indian, 13 British, six Australian, four [Indian States
Forces](/wiki/Imperial_Service_Troops "Imperial Service Troops") assigned to
airfield defence, three [Straits Settlements Volunteer
Force](/wiki/Straits_Settlements_Volunteer_Force "Straits Settlements
Volunteer Force"), and two Malayan. In addition, there were two British
machine-gun battalions, one Australian, and a British reconnaissance
battalion.[41] The newly arrived [18th Infantry
Division](/wiki/18th_Infantry_Division_\(United_Kingdom\) "18th Infantry
Division \(United Kingdom\)") (Major-General [Merton Beckwith-
Smith](/wiki/Merton_Beckwith-Smith "Merton Beckwith-Smith"))[42][43]—was at
full strength but lacked experience and training.[44] The rest of the force
was of mixed quality, condition, training, equipment and morale. Lionel
Wigmore, the [Australian official
historian](/wiki/Australia_in_the_War_of_1939%E2%80%931945 "Australia in the
War of 1939–1945") of the Malayan campaign, wrote

Percival gave Major-General [Gordon Bennett](/wiki/Gordon_Bennett_\(general\)
"Gordon Bennett \(general\)")'s two brigades from the 8th Australian Division
responsibility for the western side of Singapore, including the prime invasion
points in the northwest of the island. This was mostly mangrove swamp and
jungle, broken by rivers and creeks.[45] In the heart of the "Western Area"
was [RAF Tengah](/wiki/Tengah_Air_Base#RAF_Tengah "Tengah Air Base"),
Singapore's largest airfield at the time. The Australian 22nd Brigade, under
Brigadier Harold Taylor, was assigned a 10 mi (16 km) wide sector in the west,
and the [27th Brigade](/wiki/27th_Brigade_\(Australia\) "27th Brigade
\(Australia\)"), under Brigadier [Duncan Maxwell](/wiki/Duncan_Maxwell "Duncan
Maxwell"), had responsibility for a 4,000 yd (3,700 m) zone just west of the
Causeway. The infantry positions were reinforced by the recently arrived
Australian [2/4th Machine-Gun
Battalion](/wiki/2/4th_Machine_Gun_Battalion_\(Australia\) "2/4th Machine Gun
Battalion \(Australia\)").[46] Also under Bennett's command was the [44th
Indian Infantry Brigade](/wiki/44th_Indian_Infantry_Brigade "44th Indian
Infantry Brigade").[45]

The III Indian Corps (Lieutenant-General Sir [Lewis Heath](/wiki/Lewis_Heath
"Lewis Heath")) including the [11th Indian Infantry
Division](/wiki/11th_Infantry_Division_\(India\) "11th Infantry Division
\(India\)") under Major-General [Berthold Key](/wiki/Berthold_Wells_Key
"Berthold Wells Key") with reinforcements from the 8th Indian Brigade,[47] and
the 18th Infantry Division—was assigned the north-eastern sector, known as the
"Northern Area".[45] This included the naval base at
[Sembawang](/wiki/Sembawang "Sembawang"). The "Southern Area", including the
main urban areas in the south-east, was commanded by Major-General [Frank
Simmons](/wiki/Frank_Keith_Simmons "Frank Keith Simmons"). His forces
consisted of elements of the [1st Malaya Infantry
Brigade](/wiki/1st_Malaya_Infantry_Brigade "1st Malaya Infantry Brigade") and
the Straits Settlements Volunteer Force Brigade with the [Indian 12th Infantry
Brigade](/wiki/12th_Indian_Infantry_Brigade "12th Indian Infantry Brigade") in
reserve.[48]

From 3 February, the Commonwealth forces were shelled by Japanese artillery,
and air attacks on Singapore intensified over the next five days. The
artillery and air bombardment strengthened, severely disrupting communications
between Commonwealth units and their commanders and affecting preparations for
the defence of the island.[49] From aerial reconnaissance, scouts,
infiltrators and observation from high ground across the straits (such as at
[Istana Bukit Serene](/wiki/Istana_Bukit_Serene "Istana Bukit Serene") and the
[Sultan of Johor](/wiki/Sultan_of_Johor "Sultan of Johor")'s palace), Japanese
commander General [Tomoyuki Yamashita](/wiki/Tomoyuki_Yamashita "Tomoyuki
Yamashita") and his staff gained excellent knowledge of the Commonwealth
positions. Yamashita and his officers stationed themselves at Istana Bukit
Serene and the Johor state secretariat building—the [Sultan Ibrahim
Building](/wiki/Sultan_Ibrahim_Building "Sultan Ibrahim Building")—to plan for
the invasion of Singapore.[50][51] Although his military advisors judged that
Istana Bukit Serene was an easy target, Yamashita was confident that the
British Army would not attack the palace because it belonged to the Sultan of
Johor. Yamashita's prediction was correct; despite being observed by
Australian artillery, permission to engage the palace was denied by Gordon
Bennett.[52]

of Singapore's 15-inch coastal defence guns elevated for firing

Most of Singapore's [BL 15-inch Mk I naval
guns](/wiki/BL_15-inch_Mk_I_naval_gun "BL 15-inch Mk I naval gun") could be
traversed north and were used to engage the Japanese. The guns—which included
the [Johore Battery](/wiki/Johore_Battery "Johore Battery"), with three 15 in
(380 mm) guns and one battery with two 15 in (380 mm) guns—were supplied
mostly with [armour-piercing shells](/wiki/Armour-piercing_shell "Armour-
piercing shell") (AP) for anti-shipping use and few [high
explosive](/wiki/High_explosive#High_explosives "High explosive") (HE)
shells.[53][54][g] Percival incorrectly guessed that the Japanese would land
forces on the north-east side of Singapore, ignoring advice that the north-
west was a more likely direction of attack (where the Straits of Johor were
the narrowest and a series of river mouths provided cover for the launching of
water craft).[56] This was encouraged by the deliberate movement of Japanese
troops in this sector to deceive the British.[57] Much of the equipment and
resources of the garrison had been incorrectly allocated to the north east
sector, where the most complete and freshest formation—the 18th Infantry
Division—was deployed, while the depleted 8th Australian Division sector with
two of its three brigades had no serious fixed defensive works or obstacles.
To compound matters, Percival had ordered the Australians to defend forward so
as to cover the waterway, yet this meant they were immediately fully committed
to any fighting, limiting their flexibility, whilst also reducing their
defensive depth.[56] The two Australian brigades were subsequently allocated a
very wide frontage of over 11 mi (18 km) and were separated by the Kranji
River.[58]

Yamashita had just over 30,000 men from three divisions: the [Imperial
Guards](/wiki/Imperial_Guard_\(Japan\) "Imperial Guard \(Japan\)") Division
(Lieutenant-General [Takuma Nishimura](/wiki/Takuma_Nishimura "Takuma
Nishimura")), the [5th Division](/wiki/5th_Division_\(Imperial_Japanese_Army\)
"5th Division \(Imperial Japanese Army\)") (Lieutenant-General [Takuro
Matsui](/wiki/Takuro_Matsui "Takuro Matsui")) and the Japanese [18th
Division](/wiki/18th_Division_\(Imperial_Japanese_Army\) "18th Division
\(Imperial Japanese Army\)") (Lieutenant-General [Renya
Mutaguchi](/wiki/Renya_Mutaguchi "Renya Mutaguchi")).[59] Also in support was
a light tank brigade.[60] In comparison, following the withdrawal, Percival
had about 85,000 men at his disposal, although 15,000 were administrative
personnel, while large numbers were semi-trained British, Indian and
Australian reinforcements that had only recently arrived. Of those forces that
had seen action during the previous fighting, the majority were under-strength
and under-equipped.[61]

In the days leading up to the Japanese attack, patrols from the Australian
22nd Brigade were sent across the Straits of Johor at night to gather
intelligence. Three small patrols were sent on the evening of 6 February, one
was spotted and withdrew after its leader was killed and their boat sunk and
the other two managed to get ashore. Over the course of a day, they found
large concentrations of troops, although they were unable to locate any
landing craft.[62] The Australians requested the shelling of these positions
to disrupt the Japanese preparations but the patrol reports were later ignored
by Malaya Command as being insignificant, based upon the belief that the real
assault would come in the north-eastern sector, not the north-west.[63][64]

Singapore Island in red, the scattered Australian defensive positions in blue

Blowing up the causeway had delayed the Japanese attack for over a week. Prior
to the main assault, the Australians were subjected to an intense artillery
bombardment. Over a period of 15 hours, starting at 23:00 on 8 February 1942,
Yamashita's heavy guns fired a bombardment of 88,000 shells (200 rounds per
gun) along the straits, cutting telephone lines and isolating forward
units.[58][4][65] The British had the means to conduct counter-battery fire
opposite the Australians that would have caused casualties and disruption
among the Japanese assault troops.[66] The bombardment of the Australians was
not seen as a prelude to attack—Malaya Command believed that it would last
several days and would later switch its focus to the north-east, despite its
ferocity exceeding anything the Allies had experienced thus far in the
campaign; no order was passed to the Commonwealth artillery units to bombard
possible Japanese assembly areas.[67]

Shortly before 20:30 on 8 February, the first wave of Japanese troops from the
5th Division and 18th Division began crossing the Johor Strait. The main
weight of the Japanese force, about 13,000 men, from 16 assault battalions,
with five in reserve, attacked the 22nd Australian Brigade.[68] The assault
was received by the 2/18th Battalion and the [2/20th
Battalion](/wiki/2/20th_Battalion_\(Australia\) "2/20th Battalion
\(Australia\)"). Each Japanese division had 150 barges and collapsible boats,
sufficient for lifts of 4,000. During the first night 13,000 Japanese troops
landed and were followed by another 10,000 after first light.[69] The
Australians numbered just 3,000 men and lacked any significant reserve.[58]

As the landing craft closed on the Australian positions, machine gunners from
the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion, interspersed amongst the rifle companies,
opened fire. Spotlights had been placed on the beaches by a British unit to
illuminate an invasion force on the water but many had been damaged by the
bombardment and no order was made to turn the others on. The initial wave was
concentrated against the positions occupied by the 2/18th and 2/20th
Battalions, around the Buloh River, as well as one company from the 2/19th
Battalion. Over the course of an hour, intense fighting took place on the
right flank of the 2/19th Battalion, until its positions were overrun, the
Japanese then advanced inland concealed by the darkness and the vegetation.
The resistance put up by the company from the 2/19th pushed the follow-on
waves of Japanese craft to land around the mouth of Murai River, which
resulted in them creating a gap between the 2/19th and 2/18th battalions. From
there the Japanese launched two concerted attacks against the 2/18th, which
were met with massed fire before they overwhelmed the Australians by weight of
numbers. Urgent requests for fire support were made and the [2/15th Field
Regiment](/wiki/2/15th_Field_Regiment_\(Australia\) "2/15th Field Regiment
\(Australia\)") responded to these requests with over 4,800 rounds.[70]

Fierce fighting raged throughout the evening but due to the terrain and the
darkness, the Japanese were able to disperse into the undergrowth, surround
and overwhelm pockets of Australian resistance or bypass them exploiting gaps
in the thinly spread Commonwealth lines due to the many rivers and creeks in
the area. By midnight, the two Japanese divisions fired [star
shell](/wiki/Star_shell "Star shell") to indicate to their commander that they
had secured their initial objectives and by 01:00 they were well established.
Over the course of two hours, the three Australian battalions that had been
engaged sought to regroup, moving back east from the coast towards the centre
of the island, which was completed mainly in good order. The 2/20th managed to
concentrate three of its four companies around the Namazie Estate, although
one was left behind; the 2/18th was only able to concentrate half its strength
at Ama Keng, while the 2/19th also moved back three companies, leaving a
fourth to defend Tengah airfield. Further fighting followed in the early
morning of 9 February and the Australians were pushed back further, with the
2/18th being pushed out of Ama Keng and the 2/20th being forced to pull back
to Bulim, west of Bukit Panjong. Bypassed elements tried to break out and fall
back to the Tengah airfield to rejoin their units and suffered many
casualties. Bennett attempted to reinforce the 22nd Brigade by moving the
2/29th Battalion from the 27th Brigade area to Tengah but before it could be
used to recapture Ama Keng, the Japanese launched another attack around the
airfield and the 2/29th was forced onto the defensive.[71] The initial
fighting cost the Australians many casualties, with the 2/20th alone losing
334 men killed and 214 wounded.[72]

### Air operations

Buffalo](/wiki/Brewster_F2A_Buffalo "Brewster F2A Buffalo") fighters based at
[Sembawang Airfield](/wiki/Sembawang_Air_Base "Sembawang Air Base")

The air campaign for Singapore began during the invasion of Malaya. Early on 8
December 1941, Singapore was bombed for the first time by long-range Japanese
aircraft, such as the [Mitsubishi G3M](/wiki/Mitsubishi_G3M "Mitsubishi G3M")2
"Nell" and the [Mitsubishi G4M](/wiki/Mitsubishi_G4M "Mitsubishi G4M")1
"Betty", based in Japanese-occupied Indochina. The bombers struck the city
centre as well as the Sembawang Naval Base and the northern airfields. For the
rest of December there were false alerts and several infrequent and sporadic
hit-and-run attacks on outlying military installations such as the Naval Base
but no raids on Singapore City. The situation had become so desperate that one
British soldier took to the middle of a road to fire his [Vickers machine
gun](/wiki/Vickers_machine_gun "Vickers machine gun") at any aircraft that
passed. He could only say "The bloody bastards will never think of looking for
me in the open, and I want to see a bloody plane brought down".[73] The next
recorded raid on the city occurred on the night of 29/30 December, and nightly
raids ensued for over a week, accompanied by daylight raids from 12 January
1942.[74] As the Japanese army advanced towards Singapore Island, the day and
night raids increased in frequency and intensity, resulting in thousands of
civilian casualties, up to the time of the British surrender.[75]

In December, 51 [Hawker Hurricane](/wiki/Hawker_Hurricane "Hawker Hurricane")
Mk II fighters and 24 pilots were sent to Singapore, the nuclei of five
squadrons. They arrived on 3 January 1942, by which stage the Buffalo
squadrons had been overwhelmed. [No. 232 Squadron
RAF](/wiki/No._232_Squadron_RAF "No. 232 Squadron RAF") was formed and [No.
488 Squadron RNZAF](/wiki/No._488_Squadron_RNZAF "No. 488 Squadron RNZAF"), a
Buffalo squadron, had converted to Hurricanes; 232 Squadron became operational
on 20 January and destroyed three [Nakajima Ki-43](/wiki/Nakajima_Ki-43
"Nakajima Ki-43") "Oscars" that day, for the loss of three Hurricanes. Like
the Buffalos the Hurricanes began to suffer severe losses in dogfights.[76][h]
From 27 to 30 January, another 48 Hurricanes arrived on the aircraft carrier
[HMS  _Indomitable_](/wiki/HMS_Indomitable_\(92\) "HMS Indomitable
\(92\)").[77] Operated by the four squadrons of [No. 226 Group
RAF](/wiki/No._226_Squadron_RAF "No. 226 Squadron RAF"), they flew from an
airfield code-named P1, near [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang "Palembang"),
[Sumatra](/wiki/Sumatra "Sumatra") in the Dutch East Indies, while a flight
was maintained in Singapore.[78] Many of the Hurricanes were destroyed on the
ground by air raids.[79] The lack of an effective air early warning system
throughout the campaign meant that many Commonwealth aircraft were lost in
this manner during Japanese attacks against airfields.[80]

[![Crashed aeroplane with

shot down on 8 February, along the [East Coast
Road](/w/index.php?title=East_Coast_Park_Service_Road&action=edit&redlink=1
"East Coast Park Service Road \(page does not exist\)")

By the time of the invasion, only ten Hurricanes of 232 Squadron, based at
[RAF Kallang](/wiki/Kallang_Airport#World_War_II "Kallang Airport"), remained
to provide air cover for the Commonwealth forces on Singapore. The airfields
at Tengah, [Seletar](/wiki/Seletar_Airport#RAF_Seletar "Seletar Airport") and
[Sembawang](/wiki/Sembawang_Air_Base#RAF_Sembawang "Sembawang Air Base") were
in range of Japanese artillery at [Johor Bahru](/wiki/Johor_Bahru "Johor
Bahru"). RAF Kallang was the only operational airstrip left; the surviving
squadrons and aircraft had withdrawn by January to reinforce the Dutch East
Indies.[81] On the morning of 9 February, dogfights took place over Sarimbun
Beach and other western areas. In the first encounter, the last ten Hurricanes
were scrambled from Kallang Airfield to intercept a Japanese formation of
about 84 aircraft, flying from Johor to provide air cover for their invasion
force.[82] The Hurricanes shot down six Japanese aircraft and damaged 14
others for the loss of a Hurricane.[83]

Air battles went on for the rest of the day and by nightfall it was clear that
with the few aircraft Percival had left, Kallang could no longer be used as a
base. With his assent, the remaining flyable Hurricanes were withdrawn to
Sumatra.[84] A squadron of Hurricane fighters took to the skies on 9 February
but was then withdrawn to the Netherlands East Indies and after that no
Commonwealth aircraft were seen again over Singapore; the Japanese had
achieved air supremacy.[85][86] That evening, three [Fairmile B motor
launches](/wiki/Fairmile_B_motor_launch "Fairmile B motor launch") attacked
and sank several Japanese landing craft in the Johor Strait around its western
channel on the evening of 9 February.[85] On the evening of 10 February,
General [Archibald Wavell](/wiki/Archibald_Wavell,_1st_Earl_Wavell "Archibald
Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell"), commander of ABDA, ordered the transfer of all
remaining Commonwealth air force personnel to the Dutch East Indies. By this
time, Kallang Airfield was, according to author Frank Owen, "so pitted with
bomb craters that it was no longer usable".[87]

### Second day

Believing that further landings would occur in the northeast, Percival did not
reinforce the 22nd Brigade until the morning of 9 February, sending two half-
strength battalions from the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade. The Indians reached
Bennett around noon. Shortly afterwards Percival allocated the composite
6th/15th Indian Infantry Brigade to reinforce the Australians from their
position around the Singapore racecourse.[88] Throughout the day, the 44th
Indian Infantry Brigade, still holding its position on the coast, began to
feel pressure on its exposed flank and after discussions between Percival and
Bennett, it was decided that they would have to retire eastwards to maintain
the southern part of the Commonwealth line.[89] Bennett decided to form a
secondary defensive line, known as the "Kranji-Jurong Switch Line" facing west
between the two rivers, with its centre around Bulim, east of Tengah
Airfield—which subsequently came under Japanese control—and just north of
[Jurong](/wiki/Jurong "Jurong").[90][89]

To the north, the 27th Australian Brigade had not been engaged during the
Japanese assaults on the first day. Possessing only the
[2/26th](/wiki/2/26th_Battalion_\(Australia\) "2/26th Battalion
\(Australia\)") and 2/30th, following the transfer of the 2/29th Battalion to
the 22nd Brigade, Maxwell sought to reorganise his force to deal with the
threat posed to the western flank.[91] Late on 9 February, the Imperial Guards
began assaulting the positions held by the 27th Brigade, concentrating on
those held by the 2/26th Battalion.[92] During the initial assault, the
Japanese suffered severe casualties from Australian mortars and machine-guns
and from burning oil which had been [sluiced](/wiki/Sluice "Sluice") into the
water following the demolition of several oil tanks by the Australians.[93]
Some of the Guards reached the shore and maintained a tenuous
[beachhead](/wiki/Beachhead "Beachhead"); at the height of the assault, it is
reported that the Guards commander, Nishimura, requested permission to cancel
the attack due to the many casualties his troops had suffered from the fire
but Yamashita ordered them to press on.[94]

Communication problems caused further cracks in the Commonwealth defence.
Maxwell knew that the 22nd Brigade was under increasing pressure but was
unable to contact Taylor and was wary of encirclement.[95] As parties of
Japanese troops began to infiltrate the brigade's positions from the west,
exploiting the gap formed by the Kranji River, the 2/26th Battalion was forced
to withdraw to a position east of the Bukit Timah Road; this move precipitated
a sympathetic move by the 2/30th away from the causeway.[90] The authority for
this withdrawal would later be the subject of debate, with Bennett stating
that he had not given Maxwell authorisation to do so.[95] The result was that
the Allies lost control of the beaches adjoining the west side of the
causeway, the high ground overlooking the causeway and the left flank of the
11th Indian Division was exposed.[96] The Japanese were given a firm foothold
to "build up their force unopposed".[85]

### Japanese breakthrough

Main articles: [Battle of Bukit Timah](/wiki/Battle_of_Bukit_Timah "Battle of
Bukit Timah") and [Battle of Pasir Panjang](/wiki/Battle_of_Pasir_Panjang
"Battle of Pasir Panjang")

The opening at Kranji made it possible for Imperial Guards armoured units to
land there unopposed, after which they were able to begin ferrying across
their artillery and armour.[97][66] After finding his left flank exposed by
the withdrawal of the 27th Brigade, the commander of the 11th Indian Infantry
Division, Key, dispatched the 8th Indian Infantry Brigade from reserve, to
retake the high ground to the south of the Causeway.[98] Throughout 10
February further fighting took place around along the Jurong Line, as orders
were formulated to establish a secondary defensive line to the west of the
Reformatory Road, with troops not then employed in the Jurong Line;
misinterpretation of these orders resulted in Taylor, the commander of the
22nd Brigade, prematurely withdrawing his troops to the east, where they were
joined by a 200-strong [ad hoc](/wiki/Ad_hoc "Ad hoc") battalion of Australian
reinforcements, known as X Battalion. The Jurong Line eventually collapsed
after the 12th Indian Brigade was withdrawn by its commander, Brigadier Archie
Paris, to the road junction near Bukit Panjang, after he lost contact with the
27th Brigade on his right; the commander of the 44th Indian Brigade,
Ballantine, commanding the extreme left of the line, also misinterpreted the
orders in the same manner that Taylor had and withdrew.[99] On the evening of
10 February, British Prime Minister [Winston
Churchill](/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill"), cabled Wavell

In the early afternoon of 10 February, on learning of the collapse of the
Jurong Line, Wavell ordered Percival to launch a counter-attack to retake
it.[101] This order was passed on to Bennett, who allocated X Battalion.
Percival made plans of his own for the counter-attack, detailing a three-
phased operation that involved the majority of the 22nd Brigade, and he
subsequently passed this on to Bennett, who began implementing the plan, but
forgot to call X Battalion back. The battalion, consisting of poorly trained
and equipped replacements, advanced to an assembly area near Bukit Timah.[102]
In the early hours of 11 February, the Japanese, who had concentrated
significant forces around the Tengah airfield and on the Jurong Road, began
further offensive operations: the 5th Division aimed its advance towards Bukit
Panjang, while the 18th Division struck out towards Bukit Timah. They fell
upon X Battalion, which had camped in its assembly area while waiting to
launch its counter-attack, and two-thirds of the battalion was killed or
wounded.[103] After brushing aside elements of the 6th/15th Indian Brigade,
the Japanese again began attacking the 22nd Australian Brigade around the
Reformatory Road.[104]

Later on 11 February, with Japanese supplies running low, Yamashita attempted
to bluff Percival, calling on him to "give up this meaningless and desperate
resistance".[105][106] The fighting strength of the 22nd Brigade—which had
borne the brunt of the Japanese attacks—had been reduced to a few hundred men
and the Japanese had captured the Bukit Timah area, including the main food
and fuel depots of the garrison.[107] Wavell told Percival that the garrison
was to fight on to the end and that there should not be a general surrender in
Singapore.[108][109][110] With the vital water supply of the reservoirs in the
centre of the island threatened, the 27th Australian Brigade was later ordered
to recapture Bukit Panjang as a preliminary move in retaking Bukit Timah.[111]
The counter-attack was repulsed by the Imperial Guards and the 27th Australian
Brigade was split in half on either side of the Bukit Timah Road with elements
spread as far as the Pierce Reservoir.[112]

— Tomoyuki Yamashita[113]

The next day, as the situation worsened for the Commonwealth, they sought to
consolidate their defences; during the night of 12/13 February, the order was
given for a 28 mi (45 km) perimeter to be established around Singapore City at
the eastern end of the island. This was achieved by moving the defending
forces from the beaches along the northern shore and from around Changi, with
the 18th Infantry Division being tasked to maintain control of the vital
reservoirs and effecting a link up with Simmons' Southern Area forces.[114]
The withdrawing troops received harassing attacks all the way back.[115]
Elsewhere, the 22nd Brigade continued to hold a position west of the Holland
Road until late in the evening when it was pulled back to Holland
Village.[116]

On 13 February, Japanese engineers repaired the road over the causeway and
more tanks were pushed across.[117] With the Commonwealth still losing ground,
senior officers advised Percival to surrender in the interest of minimising
civilian casualties. Percival refused but tried to get authority from Wavell
for greater discretion as to when resistance might cease.[118][119] The
Japanese captured the water reservoirs that supplied the town but did not cut
off the supply.[120] That day, military police executed Captain [Patrick
Heenan](/wiki/Patrick_Stanley_Vaughan_Heenan "Patrick Stanley Vaughan Heenan")
for espionage.[121] An Air Liaison Officer with the British Indian Army,
Heenan had been recruited by Japanese military intelligence and had used a
radio to assist them in attacking Commonwealth airfields in northern Malaya.
He had been arrested on 10 December and court-martialled in January. Heenan
was shot at [Keppel Harbour](/wiki/Keppel_Harbour "Keppel Harbour"), on the
southern side of Singapore and his body was thrown into the sea.[122][123]

The Australians occupied a perimeter of their own to the north-west around
Tanglin Barracks, in which they maintained an all round defence as a
precaution. To their right, the 18th Division, the 11th Indian Division and
the 2nd Malaya Brigade held the perimeter from the edge of the Farrar Road
east to Kallang, while to their left, the 44th Indian Brigade and the 1st
Malaya Brigade held the perimeter from Buona Vista to Pasir Panjang.[124] For
the most part, there was limited fighting around the perimeter, except around
Pasir Panjang Ridge, 1 mi (1.6 km) from Singapore Harbour, where the 1st
Malaya Brigade—which consisted of a Malayan infantry battalion, two British
infantry battalions and a force of Royal Engineers—fought a stubborn defensive
action during the [Battle of Pasir Panjang](/wiki/Battle_of_Pasir_Panjang
"Battle of Pasir Panjang").[124][125] The Japanese largely avoided attacking
the Australian perimeter but in the northern area, the British 53rd Infantry
Brigade was pushed back by a Japanese assault up the Thompson Road and had to
fall back north of Braddell Road in the evening, joining the rest of the 18th
Infantry Division in the line. They dug in and throughout the night fierce
fighting raged on the northern front.[126]

The following day, the remaining Commonwealth units fought on. Civilian
casualties mounted as a million people crowded into the 3 mi (4.8 km) area
still held by the Commonwealth and bombing and artillery-fire increased.[127]
The civilian authorities began to fear that the water supply would give out;
Percival was advised that large amounts of water were being lost due to
damaged pipes and that the water supply was on the verge of collapse.[128][i]

On 14 February 1942, the Japanese renewed their assault on the western part of
the Southern Area's defences near the area that the 1st Malayan Brigade had
fought desperately to hold the previous day.[129][117] At about 13:00, the
Japanese broke through and advanced towards the [Alexandra Barracks
Hospital](/wiki/Alexandra_Hospital "Alexandra Hospital"). A British
lieutenant—acting as an envoy with a white flag—approached Japanese forces but
was killed with a [bayonet](/wiki/Bayonet "Bayonet").[130] After Japanese
troops entered the hospital, they killed up to 50 soldiers, including some
undergoing surgery. Doctors and nurses were also killed.[131] The next day,
about 200 male staff members and patients who had been assembled and bound the
previous day,[131] many of them walking wounded, were ordered to walk about
400 m (440 yd) to an industrial area. Those who fell on the way were
bayoneted. The men were forced into a series of small, badly ventilated rooms
where they were held overnight without water. Some died during the night as a
result of their treatment.[131] The remainder were bayoneted the following
morning.[132][133] Several survivors were identified after the war, some of
whom had survived by pretending to be dead. One survivor, Private Arthur
Haines from the [Wiltshire Regiment](/wiki/Wiltshire_Regiment "Wiltshire
Regiment"), wrote a four-page account of the massacre that was sold by his
daughter by private auction in 2008.[134]

### Fall of Singapore

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fall_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=11 "Edit

[![Nine Japanese officers sit across from three British officers at a
table](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/BritishSurrender.jpg/220px-
BritishSurrender.jpg)](/wiki/File:BritishSurrender.jpg)Yamashita (seated,
centre) thumps the table with his fist to emphasise his terms—unconditional
surrender. Percival sits between his officers, his clenched hand to his mouth.

Throughout the night of 14/15 February, the Japanese continued to press
against the Commonwealth perimeter, and though the line largely held, the
military supply situation was rapidly deteriorating. The water system was
badly damaged and supply was uncertain, rations were running low, petrol for
military vehicles was all but exhausted, and there was little ammunition left
for the field artillery and anti-aircraft guns, which were unable to disrupt
the Japanese air attacks causing many casualties in the city centre.[135]
Little work had been done to build air raid shelters, and
[looting](/wiki/Looting "Looting") and [desertion](/wiki/Desertion
"Desertion") by Commonwealth troops further added to the chaos in the
area.[136][j] At 09:30, Percival held a conference at [Fort
Canning](/wiki/Fort_Canning "Fort Canning") with his senior commanders. He
proposed two options: an immediate counter-attack to regain the reservoirs and
the military food depots around [Bukit Timah](/wiki/Bukit_Timah "Bukit
Timah"), or surrender. After a full and frank exchange of views, all present
agreed that no counter-attack was possible, and Percival opted for
surrender.[139][135] Post-war analysis has shown that a counter-attack might
have succeeded. The Japanese were at the limit of their supply line and their
artillery units were also running out of ammunition.[140]

A delegation was selected to go to the Japanese headquarters. It consisted of
a senior staff officer, the colonial secretary and an interpreter. The three
set off in a motor car bearing a [Union Jack](/wiki/Union_Jack "Union Jack")
and a white flag of truce toward the enemy lines to discuss a [cessation of
hostilities](/wiki/Cessation_of_hostilities "Cessation of hostilities").[141]
They returned with orders that Percival himself proceed with staff officers to
the [Ford Motor Factory](/wiki/Old_Ford_Motor_Factory "Old Ford Motor
Factory"), where Yamashita would lay down the terms of surrender. A further
requirement was that the Japanese [Rising Sun Flag](/wiki/Rising_Sun_Flag
"Rising Sun Flag") be hoisted over the [Cathay Building](/wiki/Cathay_Building
"Cathay Building"), the tallest building in Singapore.[142] Percival formally
surrendered shortly after 17:15.[120] Earlier that day, Percival had issued
orders to destroy all secret and technical equipment, [ciphers](/wiki/Cipher
"Cipher"), codes, secret documents and heavy guns.[143]

troops of the [Suffolk Regiment](/wiki/Suffolk_Regiment "Suffolk Regiment")
are held at gunpoint by Japanese infantry.

Under the terms of the surrender, hostilities were to cease at 20:30 that
evening, all military forces in Singapore were to surrender unconditionally,
all Commonwealth forces would remain in position and disarm themselves within
an hour, and the British were allowed to maintain a force of 1,000 armed men
to prevent looting until relieved by the Japanese. Yamashita also accepted
full responsibility for the lives of the civilians in the city.[144] Following
the surrender, Bennett caused controversy when he decided to escape. After
receiving news of the surrender, Bennett handed command of the 8th Australian
Division to the divisional artillery commander, Brigadier [Cecil
Callaghan](/wiki/Cecil_Callaghan "Cecil Callaghan") and—along with some of his
staff officers—commandeered a small boat.[145]

Bennett's party eventually made its way back to Australia while between 15,000
and 20,000 Australian soldiers were reportedly captured.[146][147][148]
Bennett blamed Percival and the Indian troops for the defeat but Callaghan
reluctantly stated that Australian units had been affected, towards the end of
the battle, by many desertions.[k][l] The Kappe Report, compiled by Colonels
J. H. Thyer and C. H. Kappe, concedes that at most only two-thirds of the
Australian troops manned the final perimeter.[149] Many British units were
reported to have been similarly affected.[138]

In analysing the campaign, Clifford Kinvig, a senior lecturer at Royal
Military Academy Sandhurst, blamed the commander of the 27th Infantry Brigade,
Brigadier Duncan Maxwell, for his defeatist attitude and not properly
defending the sector between the Causeway and the Kranji River.[151][137]
Elphick also claims that Australians made up the majority of stragglers.[152]
According to another source, Taylor cracked under the pressure.[m] Thompson
wrote that the 22nd Australian Brigade was "so heavily outnumbered that defeat
was inevitable" and Costello states that Percival's insistence on
concentrating the 22nd Australian Brigade at the water's edge had been a
serious mistake.[153][136] Yamashita, the Japanese commander, laid the blame
on the British "underestimating Japanese military capabilities" and Percival's
hesitancy in reinforcing the Australians on the western side of the
island.[154]

A classified wartime report by Wavell released in 1992 blamed the Australians
for the loss of Singapore.[28] According to [John
Coates](/wiki/John_Coates_\(general\) "John Coates \(general\)"), the report
"lacked substance", for though there had undoubtedly been a lack of discipline
in the final stages of the campaign—particularly among the poorly trained
British, Indian and Australian reinforcements that were hurriedly dispatched
as the crisis worsened—the 8th Australian Division had fought well and had
gained the respect of the Japanese.[155] At Gemas, Bakri and Jemaluang, "they
achieved the few outstanding tactical successes" of the campaign in Malaya and
although the Australians made up 13 per cent of the British Empire's ground
forces, they suffered 73 per cent of its battle deaths.[156][148] Coates
argues that the real reason for the fall of Singapore was the failure of the
Singapore strategy, to which Australian policy-makers had contributed in their
acquiescence and the lack of military resources allocated to the fighting in
Malaya.[155]

## Aftermath

### Analysis

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fall_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=13 "Edit
section: Analysis")]

The Japanese had advanced 650 mi (1,050 km) from
[Singora](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Singora "Sultanate of Singora"), Thailand, to the
southern coast of Singapore at an average rate of 9 mi (14 km) a day.[157]
While impressed with Japan's quick succession of victories, [Adolf
Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") reportedly forbade Foreign Minister
[Joachim von Ribbentrop](/wiki/Joachim_von_Ribbentrop "Joachim von
Ribbentrop") from issuing a congratulatory communique.[158] Churchill called
the fall of Singapore to the Japanese "the worst disaster and largest
capitulation in British history".[159] Churchill's physician [Lord
Moran](/wiki/Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran "Charles Wilson, 1st Baron
Moran") wrote

The loss of Singapore, along with other defeats in Southeast Asia in 1942,
reduced British prestige in the region. According to author Alan Warren, the
Fall of Singapore shattered "the British Empire's illusion of permanence ...
and strength", ultimately making "European empires in Asia unsustainable
beyond the short term" and presaging the end of colonialism in the region in
the post war period.[161]

Nearly 85,000 British, Indian and Commonwealth troops were captured, in
addition to losses during the earlier fighting in Malaya.[157] About 5,000 men
were killed or wounded, a majority of whom were Australian.[162][163] Japanese
casualties during the fighting in Singapore amounted to 1,714 killed and 3,378
wounded. During the 70-day campaign in Malaya and Singapore, total
Commonwealth casualties amounted to 8,708 killed or wounded and 130,000
captured (38,496 United Kingdom, 18,490 Australian of whom 1,789 were killed
and 1,306 wounded, 67,340 Indian and 14,382 local volunteer troops), against
9,824 Japanese casualties.[157]

The [Japanese occupation of Singapore](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore
"Japanese occupation of Singapore") started after the British surrender.
Japanese newspapers triumphantly declared the victory as deciding the general
situation of the war.[164] The city was renamed _Syonan-to_ (昭南島 _Shōnan-tō_ ;
literally: 'Southern Island gained in the age of
[Shōwa](/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dwa_period "Shōwa period")', or 'Light of the
South').[165][166] Curtin compared the loss of Singapore to the [Battle of
Dunkirk](/wiki/Battle_of_Dunkirk "Battle of Dunkirk"). The [Battle of
Britain](/wiki/Battle_of_Britain "Battle of Britain") occurred after Dunkirk;
"the fall of Singapore opens the [Battle for
Australia](/wiki/Battle_for_Australia "Battle for Australia")", Curtin said,
which threatened the Commonwealth, the United States, and the entire English-
speaking world.[167]

The Japanese sought vengeance against the Chinese and anyone who held [anti-
Japanese sentiments](/wiki/Anti-Japanese_sentiment "Anti-Japanese sentiment").
The Japanese authorities were suspicious of the Chinese because of the [Second
Sino-Japanese War](/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War "Second Sino-Japanese War"),
and murdered thousands of citizen "undesirables" (mostly ethnic Chinese) in
the [Sook Ching massacre](/wiki/Sook_Ching_massacre "Sook Ching
massacre").[168][169] The other ethnic groups of Singapore—such as the Malays
and Indians—were not spared. Residents suffered great hardships under Japanese
rule over the following three-and-a-half years.[170] Numerous British and
Australian soldiers taken prisoner remained in Singapore's [Changi
Prison](/wiki/Changi_Prison "Changi Prison") and many died in captivity.
Thousands of others were transported by sea to other parts of Asia, including
Japan, to be used as forced labour on projects such as the Siam–Burma [Death
Railway](/wiki/Burma_Railway "Burma Railway") and [Sandakan
airfield](/wiki/Sandakan_Death_Marches "Sandakan Death Marches") in [North
Borneo](/wiki/North_Borneo "North Borneo"). Many of those aboard the ships

recruiting Indian prisoners of war. In February 1942, out of approximately
40,000 Indian personnel in Singapore, about 30,000 joined the INA, of which
about 7,000 fought Commonwealth forces in the [Burma

"Imphal"); others became POW camp guards at Changi.[173] An unknown number
were taken to Japanese-occupied areas in the South Pacific as forced labour.
Many of them suffered severe hardships and brutality similar to that
experienced by other prisoners held by Japan during the war. About 6,000
survived until they could be liberated by Australian and US forces in
1943–1945, as the war in the Pacific turned in favour of the Allies.[174]

Commando raids were carried out against Japanese shipping in Singapore Harbour
in [Operation Jaywick](/wiki/Operation_Jaywick "Operation Jaywick") (1943) and
[Operation Rimau](/wiki/Operation_Rimau "Operation Rimau") (1944) to varying
success.[175] British forces had planned to reconquer Singapore in [Operation
Mailfist](/wiki/Operation_Mailfist "Operation Mailfist") in 1945, but the war
ended before it could be carried out. The island was re-occupied in [Operation
Tiderace](/wiki/Operation_Tiderace "Operation Tiderace") by British, Indian
and Australian forces following the [surrender of
Japan](/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan "Surrender of Japan") in September.[176]
Yamashita was tried by a US military commission for war crimes but not for
crimes committed by his troops in Malaya or Singapore. He was convicted and
hanged in the Philippines on 23 February 1946.[177]

## Commemoration

Main article: [Total Defence (Singapore)](/wiki/Total_Defence_\(Singapore\)
"Total Defence \(Singapore\)")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/East_side_of_War_Memorial_Park.jpg/220px-
East_side_of_War_Memorial_Park.jpg)](/wiki/File:East_side_of_War_Memorial_Park.jpg)A
memorial service is held annually at the War Memorial Park.

Since 1998, Singapore has observed [Total Defence
Day](/wiki/Total_Defence_\(Singapore\) "Total Defence \(Singapore\)") on 15
February each year, marking the anniversary of the surrender of
Singapore.[178] The concept of Total Defence as a national defence strategy
was first introduced in 1984, which serves as a significant reminder that only
[Singaporeans](/wiki/Singaporeans "Singaporeans") with a stake in the country
can effectively defend [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore "Singapore") from future
threats.[179] Yearly observances on that day include:

  * Since 1967, a memorial service is held at the [War Memorial Park](/wiki/War_Memorial_Park,_Singapore "War Memorial Park, Singapore") to recognise civilians who had lost their lives during the Japanese occupation;
  * Since 1998, sirens on the [Public Warning System](/wiki/Public_Warning_System_\(Singapore\) "Public Warning System \(Singapore\)") are sounded throughout the country (initially at 12.05 p.m.), with the [Singapore Civil Defence Force](/wiki/Singapore_Civil_Defence_Force "Singapore Civil Defence Force") broadcasting an Important Message Signal through the sirens as well as local radio stations; and Singaporean schools conducting emergency preparedness drills, including food and electricity rationing exercises; and
  * Since 2015, the timing for the sounding of the sirens has been shifted to 6.20 p.m., corresponding with the actual time of the surrender of Singapore in 1942.[180]

## Notes

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fall_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=18 "Edit
section: Notes")]

  1. **^** On Singapore, the Japanese captured 300 field guns, 180 mortars, 100 anti-aircraft guns, 54 fortress guns, and 108 1-pounder guns, as well as 200 armoured vehicles (Universal Carriers and armoured cars) and 1,800 lorries.[1]
  2. **^** Blackburn and Hack give a total of 226 for British artillery pieces captured during the siege of Singapore itself, including fortress guns (172 without them),[2] but this appears to exclude 3.7 to 4.5-inch howitzers and 75 mm field guns.[3]
  3. **^** [Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters "Simplified Chinese characters"): 新加坡戰役;  
[Malay](/wiki/Malay_language "Malay language"): _Pertempuran Singapura_ ;  
[Tamil](/wiki/Tamil_language "Tamil language"): சிங்கப்பூரின் வீழ்ச்சி;  
[Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language"): シンガポールの戦い

  4. **^** Two brigades from the 8th Australian Division had been dispatched to Singapore and then Malaya in February 1941, while its third brigade had been dispersed to garrison [Rabaul](/wiki/Rabaul "Rabaul"), [Timor](/wiki/Timor "Timor") and [Ambon](/wiki/Ambon_Island "Ambon Island").[26]
  5. **^** The number of Japanese killed and wounded is disputed.[28]
  6. **^** The war establishment, the paper strength, of an infantry division from 1941 to 1944, was 17,298 men.[40]
  7. **^** Military analysts later estimated that if the guns had been well supplied with HE shells the Japanese attackers would have suffered heavy casualties but the invasion could not have been prevented by this means alone.[55]
  8. **^** 64 Sentai lost three Ki-43s and claimed five Hurricanes.[76]
  9. **^** See the article on [David Murnane](/wiki/D._J._Murnane "D. J. Murnane") for a discussion of his role as the Singapore Municipal Water Engineer in assessing the condition of the water supply.
  10. **^** During this time a number of witnesses claim that Australian deserters were involved in widespread looting, while others were alleged to have pushed women off the gangways to get aboard the departing ships evacuating the civilians.[137] Thompson argues that the identity of these troops is disputed, recounting that around this time some British troops had broken into some of the Australian equipment stores and stolen Australian slouch hats and that further investigations had found that the offending soldiers had worn the black boots issued to British troops, rather than the brown boots worn by Australians.[138]
  11. **^** "Bennett singled out Indian troops but did not confine his remarks to them. He admitted that towards the end it was all but impossible to return men to their units ... Callaghan recommended that on any clash Percival's report be accepted as more reliable ... Regarding the many reports of Australians hiding in town or trying to escape, Callaghan bluntly admitted "there is a certain amount of truth in both these statements ... This temporary lapse of the Australian on the island and the criticism it has invoked has caused me a lot of uneasiness"."[149]
  12. **^** According to Woodburn-Kirby the majority of deserters were from administrative units or were men who had only recently arrived in Malaya and were inadequately trained.[150]
  13. **^** In the 2002 documentary _No Prisoners_ , Major John Wyett, an 8th Australian Division staff officer, claimed the commander of the 22nd Australian Brigade cracked under the pressure, stating, "Taylor was wandering around rather like a man in a sleep walk. He was utterly, utterly, you know, shell-shocked and not able to do very much".[137]
