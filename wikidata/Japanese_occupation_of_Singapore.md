name for [Singapore](/wiki/Colony_of_Singapore "Colony of Singapore") when it
was occupied and ruled by the [Empire of Japan](/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire
of Japan"), following the fall and surrender of British military forces on 15
February 1942 during [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II").

Japanese military forces occupied it after defeating the combined British,
[Indian](/wiki/British_Raj "British Raj"), [Australian](/wiki/Australia
"Australia"), [Malayan](/wiki/British_Malaya "British Malaya") and the
[Straits Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements "Straits Settlements")
garrison in the [Battle of Singapore](/wiki/Battle_of_Singapore "Battle of
Singapore"). The occupation was to become a major turning point in the
histories of several nations, including those of [Japan](/wiki/Japan "Japan"),
Britain, and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore "Singapore"). Singapore was renamed
Syonan-to, meaning "Light of the South Island" and was also included as part
of the [Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere](/wiki/Greater_East_Asia_Co-
Prosperity_Sphere "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere")
([Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language"): 大東亜共栄圏,
[Hepburn](/wiki/Hepburn_romanization "Hepburn romanization"): _Dai Tōa

Singapore was officially returned to British colonial rule on 12 September
1945, following the formal signing of the surrender at the [Municipal
Building](/wiki/Municipal_Building,_Singapore "Municipal Building,
Singapore"), currently known as City Hall. After the return of the British,
there was growing political sentiments amongst the local populace in tandem
with the rise of [anti-colonial](/wiki/Anti-colonialism "Anti-colonialism")
and [nationalist](/wiki/Nationalism "Nationalism") fervor, as many felt that
the British were no longer competent with the administration and defence of
the crown colony and its inhabitants.[7]

Shortly after the war, the Straits Settlements was dissolved and Singapore
became a separate [crown colony](/wiki/Colony_of_Singapore "Colony of
Singapore") in 1946. It would go on to achieve [self-governance](/wiki/Self-
governance_of_Singapore "Self-governance of Singapore") in 1959 and join with
[Malaya](/wiki/Federation_of_Malaya "Federation of Malaya") to form
[Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia "Malaysia") in 1963, before becoming a
[sovereign](/wiki/Sovereign_state "Sovereign state") [city-state](/wiki/City-
state "City-state") a few years later in 1965. The day of the surrender of the
British to the Japanese in 1942 continues to be commemorated in Singapore with
[Total Defence Day](/wiki/Total_Defence_\(Singapore\) "Total Defence
\(Singapore\)"), which is marked annually on 15 February.

## Events leading to the occupation

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=1
"Edit section: Events leading to the occupation")]

Further information: [Battle of Singapore](/wiki/Battle_of_Singapore "Battle
of Singapore") and [Malayan Campaign](/wiki/Malayan_Campaign "Malayan
Campaign")

On 8 December 1941, Singapore was hit by the first Japanese bombs. After the
air strike, the Japanese forces focused their invasion on Malaya (present-day
Peninsular Malaysia). During that time, the people in Malaya and Singapore
thought the British rulers could defend them. However, the Japanese had
soldiers well-trained in jungle warfare. They used light tanks and bicycles to
move quickly through the jungle. As a result, they managed to capture Malaya
within 55 days. By 31 January 1942, the Japanese forces had captured Johor
Bahru. The British forces retreated from Malaya to Singapore. They then blew
up the Johor-Singapore Causeway, which linked Malaya and Singapore. They
wanted to delay the Japanese forces from entering Singapore. The British plan
for the defense of Singapore was to guard against attacks from the sea so they
put up coastal defenses guarding the southern coastline of Singapore. However,
the Japanese forces entered Singapore via the northwestern coastline. On 7
February 1942, the Japanese forces attacked Pulau Ubin to mislead the British
forces into thinking that they would attack Singapore from the northeast, and
the British concentrated their forces on the north-eastern side of Singapore,
and distributed the rest of their troops across the island. The very next day,
The Japanese forces made use of boats to cross the Straits of Johor. On 9
February 1942, The Japanese forces repaired the Causeway, which had been blown
up by the British forces and crossed into Singapore. 2 days later, the
Japanese forces reached a reservoir in Bukit Timah. This was also where the
British kept their food and weapons. Fierce fighting took place, with Chinese
volunteers and British forces fighting against the Japanese forces. In the
end, the British forces lost the battle. Many soldiers were killed on both
sides. On 12 February, the Japanese forces attacked Fort Siloso at Sentosa.
The British forces sank one of the Japanese ships. The next day, a fierce
battle took place between the British forces and the Japanese forces at Pasir
Panjang, where the British forces kept their military stores. Fighting
alongside the British were soldiers from the Malay Regiment. They were led by
Lieutenant Adnan bin Saidi who died in the battle. The next day, Japanese
soldiers charged into the Alexandra Military Hospital (present-day Alexandra
Hospital), where they killed more than 200 hospital staff and patients. The
British decided to surrender. The supplies of water, food and ammunition were
running out, and the soldiers were tired. The British wanted to prevent more
deaths. On the evening of 15 February 1942, Lieutenant-General Arthur Ernest
Percival, the leader of the British forces in Singapore, met Lieutenant-
General Tomoyuki Yamashita, the leader of the Japanese forces tasked to
capture Malaya and Singapore. At the meeting, the British forces surrendered
Singapore to the Japanese forces.

## Life during the occupation

### Time of mass-terror

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=3
"Edit section: Time of mass-terror")]

Main article: [Japanese war crimes](/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes "Japanese war
crimes")

See also: [Double Tenth Incident](/wiki/Double_Tenth_Incident "Double Tenth
Incident")

The main army which took Malaya, the 25th Army, was redeployed to other fronts
such as the Philippines and New Guinea shortly after the fall of Singapore.
The _[Kempeitai](/wiki/Kempeitai "Kempeitai")_ (the Japanese [military
police](/wiki/Military_police "Military police")), which was the dominant
occupation unit in Singapore, committed numerous atrocities towards the common
people. They introduced the system of "_[Sook Ching](/wiki/Sook_Ching "Sook
Ching")_ ", meaning "purging through purification" in
[Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language"), to get rid of those,
especially [ethnic Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_Singaporean "Chinese Singaporean"),
deemed to be hostile to the [Empire of Japan](/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of
Japan") (anti-Japanese elements in the local population). The Sook Ching
massacres claimed the lives of between 25,000 and 55,000 ethnic Chinese in
Singapore as well as in neighboring Malaya. These victims, mainly males
between the ages of 18 and 50, were rounded up and taken to deserted spots and
remote locations around the island, such as [Changi](/wiki/Changi "Changi")
Beach, Punggol Point, and Siglap, and killed systematically using machine guns
and rifles.

Moreover, the _Kempeitai_ established an island-wide network of local
informants to help them identify those they suspected as anti-Japanese. These
informers were well-paid by the _Kempeitai_ and had no fear of being arrested
for their loyalty was not in question to the occupation forces. These
informers worked at Kempeitai screening centres where the Japanese attempted
to single out anti-Japanese elements for execution. Japanese soldiers and
Kempeitai officers patrolled the streets often and all commoners had to bow to
them with respect when they passed by. Those who failed to do so would be
slapped, punched, beaten and some people would even be taken away to
imprisonment or even face execution.

### Other changes to life in Singapore

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=4
"Edit section: Other changes to life in Singapore")]

To discourage Western influence, which Japan sought to eliminate from the very
start of their invasion, the Japanese set up schools and education
institutions and pressured the local people to learn their language
(Japanese). Textbooks and language guidebooks were printed in Japanese and
radios and movies were broadcast and screened in Japanese. Every morning,
school-children had to stand facing the direction of Japan (in the case of
Singapore, looking northeast) and sing the Japanese national anthem
("[Kimigayo](/wiki/Kimigayo "Kimigayo")"). Japanese propaganda banners and
posters also went up all around Singapore, as did many Japanese Rising Sun
flags raised and hung across many major buildings.

### Scarcity of basic needs

ten-dollar "[Banana Money](/wiki/Banana_money "Banana money")" note issued
during the war

Basic resources, ranging from food to medication, were scarce during the
occupation. The prices of basic necessities increased drastically over the
three and a half years due to [hyperinflation](/wiki/Hyperinflation
"Hyperinflation"). For example, the price of rice increased from
[$](/wiki/Malayan_dollar "Malayan dollar")5 per 100 [catties](/wiki/Catty
"Catty") (about 60 kg or 130 lb) to [$](/wiki/Japanese_government-
issued_dollar_in_Malaya_and_Borneo "Japanese government-issued dollar in
Malaya and Borneo")5,000 by the end of the occupation between August and
September 1945. The Japanese issued [ration cards](/wiki/Ration_card "Ration
card"), also known as "Peace Living Certificates",[8] which were very precious
to the people at that time, to limit the amount of resources distributed to
the civilian population. Adults could purchase 5 kg (11 lb) of rice per month
and children received 2 kg (4.4 lb) accordingly. The amount of rice for adults
was reduced by 25% as the war progressed, as much of the scarce rice supplies
were sent to feed the Japanese military.[9]

The Japanese issued "[Banana Money](/wiki/Banana_money "Banana money")" (so
referred to due to the image of a [banana](/wiki/Banana "Banana") tree printed
on most of such notes of the currency) as their main currency during the
occupation period since British [Straits currency](/wiki/Straits_dollar
"Straits dollar") became rarer and was subsequently phased out when the
Japanese took over in 1942. They instituted elements of a [command
economy](/wiki/Planned_economy "Planned economy") in which there were
restrictions on the demand and supply of resources, thus creating a popular
[black market](/wiki/Black_market "Black market") from which the locals could
obtain key scarce resources such as rice, meat, and medicine. The "Banana"
currency started to suffer from high inflation and dropped drastically in
value because the occupation authorities would simply print more whenever they
needed it;[10] consequently on the black market, Straits currency was more
widely used.

Food availability and quality decreased greatly. [Sweet
potatoes](/wiki/Sweet_potato "Sweet potato"), [tapiocas](/wiki/Tapioca
"Tapioca") and [yams](/wiki/Yam_\(vegetable\) "Yam \(vegetable\)") became the
[staple food](/wiki/Staple_food "Staple food") of most diets of many
Singaporeans because they were considerably cheaper than rice and could also
be grown fast and easily in backyard gardens. They were then turned into a
variety of dishes, as both desserts and all three meals of the day. Such foods
helped to fend [starvation](/wiki/Starvation "Starvation") off, with limited
success in terms of nutrients gained, and new ways of consuming sweet
potatoes, tapiocas and yams with other products were regularly invented and
created to help stave off the monotony. Both the British colonial and Japanese
occupation authorities encouraged their local population to [grow their own
food](/wiki/Agriculture "Agriculture") even if they had the smallest amount of
land. The encouragement and production were similar to what occurred with
"[Victory Gardens](/wiki/Victory_garden "Victory garden")" in Western nations
(predominantly in Europe) during World War II[11] as food supplies grew ever
scarcer. _[Ipomoea aquatica](/wiki/Ipomoea_aquatica "Ipomoea aquatica")_ ,
which grew relatively easily and flourished relatively well near water
sources, became a popular food-crop just as it did the other vegetables.

## Education

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=6
"Edit section: Education")]

After taking Singapore, the Japanese established the Shonan Japanese School
(昭南日本学園, _Shōnan Nihon Gakuen_), to educate the Malays, Chinese, Indians, and
Eurasians in the Japanese language. Faye Yuan Kleeman, the author of _Under an
Imperial Sun: Japanese Colonial Literature of Taiwan and the South_ wrote that
it was the most successful of such schools in Southeast Asia.[12] During the
occupation, the Japanese had also opened the Shonan First People's School.[13]

Force](/wiki/Z_Special_Unit "Z Special Unit") following the success of
[Operation Jaywick](/wiki/Operation_Jaywick "Operation Jaywick")

Singapore was the target of various operations masterminded by Allied forces
to disrupt Japanese military activities. On 26 September 1943, an Allied
[commando](/wiki/Commando "Commando") unit known as [Z
Force](/wiki/Z_Special_Unit "Z Special Unit") led by Major Ivan Lyon
infiltrated Singapore Harbour and [sank or damaged seven Japanese
ships](/wiki/Operation_Jaywick "Operation Jaywick") comprising over 39,000
[long tons](/wiki/Long_ton "Long ton") (40,000 [metric tons](/wiki/Tonne
"Tonne")). Lyon led another operation, codenamed "Rimau", with the same
objective almost a year later and sank three ships. Lyon and 13 of his men
were killed fighting the Japanese during this operation. The other 10 men who
participated in the operation were captured, charged with espionage in a
[kangaroo court](/wiki/Kangaroo_court "Kangaroo court") and subsequently
executed.

[Lim Bo Seng](/wiki/Lim_Bo_Seng "Lim Bo Seng") of [Force 136](/wiki/Force_136
"Force 136") led another operation, code-named
[_Gustavus_](/wiki/Lim_Bo_Seng#Operation_Gustavus "Lim Bo Seng"), he recruited
and trained hundreds of secret agents through intensive military intelligence
missions from China and India. He set up the Sino-British
[guerrilla](/wiki/Guerrilla "Guerrilla") task force [Force
136](/wiki/Force_136 "Force 136") in 1942 with Captain John Davis of the
[Special Operations Executive](/wiki/Special_Operations_Executive "Special
Operations Executive") (SOE). Operation Gustavus was aimed at establishing an
espionage network in Malaya and Singapore to gather intelligence about
Japanese activities, and thereby aid the British in [Operation
Zipper](/wiki/Operation_Zipper "Operation Zipper") – the code name for their
plan to take back Singapore from the Japanese. Force 136 was eventually
disbanded after the war.

In August 1945, two [XE class midget submarines](/wiki/XE_class_submarine "XE
class submarine") of the [Royal Navy](/wiki/Royal_Navy "Royal Navy") took part
in [Operation Struggle](/wiki/XE_class_submarine#Operation_Struggle "XE class
submarine"), a plan to infiltrate Singapore Harbour and sabotage the Japanese
cruisers [_Takao_](/wiki/Japanese_cruiser_Takao_\(1930\) "Japanese cruiser
Takao \(1930\)") and [_Myōkō_](/wiki/Japanese_cruiser_My%C5%8Dk%C5%8D
"Japanese cruiser Myōkō") using [limpet mines](/wiki/Limpet_mine "Limpet
mine"). They inflicted heavy damage on _Takao_ , earning Lieutenant [Ian
Edward Fraser](/wiki/Ian_Edward_Fraser "Ian Edward Fraser") the [Victoria
Cross](/wiki/Victoria_Cross "Victoria Cross"). From November 1944 to May 1945,
Singapore was subjected to [air
raids](/wiki/Bombing_of_Singapore_\(1944%E2%80%931945\) "Bombing of Singapore
\(1944–1945\)") by British and American long-range bomber units.

Naval facilities and docks in Singapore were also [bombed on eleven
occasions](/wiki/Bombing_of_Singapore_\(1944%E2%80%9345\) "Bombing of
Singapore \(1944–45\)") by American air units between November 1944 and May
1945. These attacks caused some damage to their targets but also killed a
number of civilians. Most Singaporeans, however, welcomed the raids as they
were seen as heralding Singapore's liberation from Japanese rule.

On 6 August 1945, the United States detonated an atomic bomb over the Japanese
city of Hiroshima. Sixteen hours later, US President Harry S. Truman called
again for Japan's surrender and warned it to "expect a rain of ruin from the
air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth." On 8 August 1945,
the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and the next day invaded the Japanese
puppet state of [Manchukuo](/wiki/Manchukuo "Manchukuo"). Later that day, the
United States dropped a second atomic bomb, this time on the Japanese city of
Nagasaki. Following those events, Emperor Hirohito intervened and ordered the
Supreme Council for the Direction of the War to accept the terms the Allies
had set down in the Potsdam Declaration to end the war. After several more
days of behind-the-scenes negotiations and a failed coup d'état, Emperor
Hirohito gave a recorded radio address across the Empire on 15 August. In the
[radio address](/wiki/Hirohito_surrender_broadcast "Hirohito surrender
broadcast"), he announced the surrender of Japan to the Allies.

The surrender ceremony was held on 2 September aboard the United States Navy
battleship USS Missouri at which officials from the Japanese government signed
the Japanese Instrument of Surrender, thereby ending the hostilities.

On 12 September 1945, a surrender instrument was signed at the Singapore
[Municipal Building](/wiki/Municipal_Building,_Singapore "Municipal Building,
Singapore"). That was followed by a celebration at the
[Padang](/wiki/Padang,_Singapore "Padang, Singapore"), which included a
victory parade. [Lord Louis
Mountbatten](/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma "Louis
Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma"), [Supreme Allied
Commander](/wiki/Supreme_Allied_Commander "Supreme Allied Commander") of
[South East Asia Command](/wiki/South_East_Asia_Command "South East Asia

forces in the region from General [Seishirō
Itagaki](/wiki/Seishir%C5%8D_Itagaki "Seishirō Itagaki") on behalf of Field
Marshal [Hisaichi Terauchi](/wiki/Hisaichi_Terauchi "Hisaichi Terauchi"). A
British military administration, using surrendered Japanese troops as security
forces, was formed to govern the island until March 1946.

After the Japanese surrendered, there was a state of instability
([anomie](/wiki/Anomie "Anomie")) in Singapore, as the British had not yet
arrived to take control. The Japanese occupiers had a considerably weakened
hold over the populace. There were widespread incidents of
[looting](/wiki/Looting "Looting") and revenge killing. Much of the
infrastructure had been wrecked, including the harbour facilities and the
electricity, water supply and telephone services. It took four or five years
for the economy to return to prewar levels. When British troops finally
arrived, they were met with cheering and fanfare.

Banana money became worthless after the occupation ended.

with some at the former massacre sites:

### Civilian War Memorial

Memorial](/wiki/Civilian_War_Memorial "Civilian War Memorial") is located in
the War Memorial Park at [Beach Road](/wiki/Beach_Road,_Singapore "Beach Road,

memorial commemorates the civilian dead of all races. It was built after
thousands of remains were discovered all over Singapore during the urban
redevelopment boom in the early 1960s. The memorial was officially unveiled by
Singapore's first prime minister [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew "Lee Kuan
Yew") on the 25th anniversary of the start of the Japanese occupation in
1967.[14] It was constructed with part of the S$50 million 'blood debt'
compensation paid by the Japanese government in October 1966.[14] Speaking at
the unveiling ceremony, Lee said:

> We meet to remember the men and women who were the hapless victims of one of
> the fires of history... If today we remember these lessons of the past, we
> strengthen our resolve and determination to make our future more secure then
> these men and women for whom we mourn would not have [died in

On 15 February every year, memorial services (opened to the public) are held
at the memorial.

## Notes

"Edit section: Notes")]

  1. **^** Although the Empire of Japan officially had no state religion,[3][4] [Shinto](/wiki/Shinto "Shinto") played an important part for the Japanese state: As [Marius Jansen](/wiki/Marius_Jansen "Marius Jansen"), states: "The Meiji government had from the first incorporated, and in a sense created, Shinto, and utilized its tales of the divine origin of the ruling house as the core of its ritual addressed to ancestors "of ages past." As the Japanese empire grew the affirmation of a divine mission for the Japanese race was emphasized more strongly. Shinto was imposed on colonial lands in Taiwan and Korea, and public funds were utilized to build and maintain new shrines there. Shinto priests were attached to army units as chaplains, and the cult of war dead, enshrined at the Yasukuni Jinja in Tokyo, took on ever greater proportions as their number grew."(Marius B. Jansen 2002, p. 669)
