The **early history of Singapore** refers to its pre-colonial era before 1819,
when the British [East India Company](/wiki/East_India_Company "East India
Company") led by [Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles "Stamford Raffles")
established a trading settlement on the island and set in motion the [history
of modern Singapore](/wiki/History_of_Singapore "History of Singapore").

Prior to 1819, the island was known by several names. An early reference may
be in the 2nd century work by [Ptolemy](/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") which
identified a coastal port at the southernmost tip of the [Malay
Peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula "Malay Peninsula"), called _Sabana_. However,
historians generally attribute a 3rd-century Chinese traveller's record
describing an island at the same location called _Pu Luo Chung_ , a
transcription of [Singapura](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura "Kingdom of
Singapura")'s early [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language "Malay language") name [Pulau
Ujong](/wiki/Pulau_Ujong "Pulau Ujong"), as the first recording of its
existence.

Singapore was known in the 13th to 14th century as [Temasek](/wiki/Temasek
"Temasek"), with its name being changed to
[Singapura](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura "Kingdom of Singapura") perhaps towards
the end of 14th century by [Sang Nila Utama](/wiki/Sang_Nila_Utama "Sang Nila
Utama"), the founder of [Kingdom of Singapura](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura
"Kingdom of Singapura"). The island was alternately claimed during this period
by the [Siamese](/wiki/Thai_people "Thai people") and the
[Javanese](/wiki/Javanese_people "Javanese people"). The last ruler of
Singapura, [Parameswara](/wiki/Parameswara_of_Malacca "Parameswara of
Malacca") fled to Malacca after an attack by either the
[Javanese](/wiki/Javanese_people "Javanese people") or
[Siamese](/wiki/Thai_people "Thai people"), and established the state of
Malacca. It was controlled by the [Malacca Sultanate](/wiki/Malacca_Sultanate
"Malacca Sultanate") in the 15th century and the [Johor
Sultanate](/wiki/Johor_Sultanate "Johor Sultanate") from the 16th century, up
till its founding as a British colony in the 19th century.

## Early period

Ptolemy_Asia_detail.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ptolemy_Asia_detail.jpg)Ptolemy,
_Geographia_ , VIII. 11th Map of Asia. Sabana given at the tip of the Malay
Peninsula which was named as the [Golden Khersonese](/wiki/Golden_Chersonese
"Golden Chersonese").

From primary historical texts dated before the 14th century, scholars have
identified some 24 names that possibly referred to the island of Singapore.[1]
The first possible mention of early Singapore dates to 2nd century
[CE](/wiki/Common_era "Common era") cartographic references in the Greco-Roman
astronomer [Ptolemy](/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy")'s
_[Geographia](/wiki/Geography_\(Ptolemy\) "Geography \(Ptolemy\)")_. A place
called _Sabana_ or _Sabara_ was marked on the 11th Map of Asia at the southern
tip of the [Golden Khersonese](/wiki/Golden_Khersonese "Golden Khersonese")
(meaning the [Malay Peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula "Malay Peninsula")) where
Singapore may lie.[2] It was identified as a
_nominon[emporion](/wiki/Emporium_\(antiquity\) "Emporium \(antiquity\)")_ or
designated foreign trading port, as part of a chain of similar trading centres
that linked Southeast Asia with India and the
[Mediterranean](/wiki/Mediterranean "Mediterranean").[3] Identification of
_Sabana_ or _Sabara_ however varies, with various authors proposing it to be
in [Selangor](/wiki/Selangor "Selangor") or near [Klang](/wiki/Klang_\(city\)
"Klang \(city\)"), or just south of [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca "Malacca"), or
south [Johor](/wiki/Johor "Johor"), as well as Singapore island itself. No
archaeological evidence from this period has yet been found in
Singapore.[2][4]

A 3rd century Chinese written record described a locality named _Pu Luo Zhong_
(蒲羅中), possibly a transcription of the [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language "Malay
language") _Pulau Ujong_ , "island at the end" (of the [Malay
Peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula "Malay Peninsula")), i.e. [Singapore
Island](/wiki/Singapore_Island "Singapore Island").[5] It mentions briefly a
[hearsay](/wiki/Hearsay "Hearsay") account of cannibals with 5 or 6-inch tails
living there.[6] The extent to which _Pu Luo Zhong_ can be identified with
Singapore is still debated today.[7]

Another possible reference to Singapore was found in the _[Nanhai Jigui Neifa
Zhuan](/wiki/A_Record_of_Buddhist_Practices_Sent_Home_from_the_Southern_Sea "A
Record of Buddhist Practices Sent Home from the Southern Sea")_ (A Record of
Buddhist Practices Sent Home from the Southern Sea), travel accounts of the
Buddhist monk [Yijing](/wiki/Yijing_\(monk\) "Yijing \(monk\)") from the
[Tang](/wiki/Tang_dynasty "Tang dynasty") dynasty. Yijing mentioned several
islands located in today's Southeast Asia. One of which, called Mo-he-xin or
Mo-ho-hsin (摩诃新), was argued by Brian E. Colless to be the ancient
Singapore.[8]

### Singapore Stone

NationalMuseumofSingapore-20090712.jpg)A fragment of the [Singapore
Stone](/wiki/Singapore_Stone "Singapore Stone"), inscribed with an unknown
script, c 10th to 13th century.

Main article: [Singapore Stone](/wiki/Singapore_Stone "Singapore Stone")

A large boulder measuring 3 metres in height and width, inscribed with
writings, used to exist at the mouth of the [Singapore
River](/wiki/Singapore_River "Singapore River"), but was later blown up when
Fort Fullerton was expanded and the river mouth widened. Only a few fragments
survive, and it became known as the [Singapore Stone](/wiki/Singapore_Stone
"Singapore Stone"). Various dates between 10th to 13th century have been
proposed for the inscriptions that is as yet undeciphered, and the script is
suggested to be related to that used in Sumatran in that period.[9][10]

## Temasek

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Early_history_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=3
"Edit section: Temasek")]

Main article: [Temasek](/wiki/Temasek "Temasek")

Early Singapore was called "Temasek", possibly a word deriving from "_tasik_ "
(Malay for lake or sea) and taken to mean Sea-town in Malay.[11] The
[Nagarakretagama](/wiki/Nagarakretagama "Nagarakretagama"), a
[Javanese](/wiki/Java_\(island\) "Java \(island\)") eulogy written in 1365,
listed a settlement on the island called _Tumasik_ as a vassal of the
Majapahit.[12] The name is also mentioned in the _[Malay
Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals "Malay Annals")_ thought to have been written in
1535.[11] Temasek may have diplomatic relationship with Vietnam, which
recorded it as _Sach Ma Tich_ , as early as the 13th century.[13] It is also
recorded by the Chinese traveller [Wang Dayuan](/wiki/Wang_Dayuan "Wang
Dayuan") who visited the island around 1330 and described a place called _Dan
Ma Xi_ (單馬錫, a [transcription](/wiki/Transcription_into_Chinese_characters
"Transcription into Chinese characters") of the Malay _Temasek_). The name
_Dan Ma Xi_ or _Temasek_ is written in Chinese as 淡馬錫 in the [Mao Kun
map](/wiki/Mao_Kun_map "Mao Kun map").

### Long Ya Men and Ban Zu

Zhi](/wiki/Wubei_Zhi "Wubei Zhi") based on the early 15th century navigation
maps of [Zheng He](/wiki/Zheng_He "Zheng He"), showing [Temasek](/wiki/Temasek
"Temasek") (淡馬錫) at the top left, and [Longyamen](/wiki/Longyamen "Longyamen")
(龍牙門) in the right panel. Temasek was described as having two different
settlements by [Wang Dayuan](/wiki/Wang_Dayuan "Wang Dayuan"), _Longyamen_ and
_[Banzu](/wiki/Banzu "Banzu")_.

Main articles: [Long Ya Men](/wiki/Long_Ya_Men "Long Ya Men") and [Ban
Zu](/wiki/Ban_Zu "Ban Zu")

It was recorded in 1320 that the [Mongol](/wiki/Mongol_Empire "Mongol Empire")
sent a mission to obtain elephants from _[Long Ya Men](/wiki/Long_Ya_Men "Long
Ya Men")_ (龍牙門, _Dragon's Teeth Gate_).[14] The people of _Longyamen_ then
responded in 1325 with a tribute and trade mission to China.[15] _Long Ya Men_
is believed to be the entrance to the modern-day [Keppel
Harbour](/wiki/Keppel_Harbour "Keppel Harbour"). In his work _[Daoyi
Zhilüe](/wiki/Daoyi_Zhil%C3%BCe "Daoyi Zhilüe")_ , Wang Dayuan described _Long
Ya Men_ as the two hills of Temasek that looked like "Dragon's teeth" between
which a strait runs, and wrote about the place:

> The fields are barren and there is little [padi](/wiki/Paddy_field "Paddy
> field") ... In ancient times, when digging in the ground, a chief came upon
> a jewelled head-dress. The beginning of the year is calculated from the
> [first] rising of the moon, when the chief put on this head-gear and wore
> his [ceremonial] dress to receive the congratulations [of the people].
> Nowadays this custom is still continued. The natives and Chinese dwell side
> by side. Most [of the natives] gather their hair into a
> [chignon](/wiki/Chignon_\(hairstyle\) "Chignon \(hairstyle\)"), and wear

Wang further mentioned that [lakawood](/wiki/Lakawood "Lakawood") and tin was
produced there and the natives traded with Chinese from
[Quanzhou](/wiki/Quanzhou "Quanzhou"), but Chinese [junks](/wiki/Junks
"Junks") on their way back from the Western Oceans (西洋) may be met by pirates
there who attacked with two to three hundred [perahus](/wiki/Perahu "Perahu")
(boats).[17] Wang described another settlement on a hill behind _Long Ya Men_
called _[Ban Zu](/wiki/Ban_Zu "Ban Zu")_ (班卒, a transcription of the Malay
name _pancur_ meaning a "spring"). It is thought to be located on [Fort
Canning Hill](/wiki/Fort_Canning_Hill "Fort Canning Hill"), and a spring used
to exist on the west side of the hill.[18] In contrast to those of _Long Ya
Men_ who were prone to piracy, the inhabitants of _Ban Zu_ were described as
honest, and they wore "their hair short, with turban of gold-brocaded satin,"
and were dressed in red cloth.[19]

Wang also reported that the Siamese attacked Temasek (with no specific
reference of Long Ya Men or Ban Zu) a few years before he visited, but the
fortified city survived the attack which lasted a month.[20] Ruins of the
settlement on the hill were still visible in the early 19th century and were
described by the Resident [John Crawfurd](/wiki/John_Crawfurd "John
Crawfurd"). In 1928, pieces of gold ornaments dating to the mid-14th century
was discovered at Fort Canning Hill.[21]

[Recent excavations](/wiki/Archaeology_in_Singapore "Archaeology in
Singapore") in [Fort Canning](/wiki/Fort_Canning "Fort Canning") provide
evidence that Singapore was a port of some importance in the 14th century[22]
and used for transactions between Malays and Chinese. Various documents
suggest that following the decline of Srivijaya power, Temasek was alternately
claimed by the Majapahit and the Siamese [Ayutthaya
Kingdom](/wiki/Ayutthaya_Kingdom "Ayutthaya Kingdom").

Main article: [Kingdom of Singapura](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura "Kingdom of
Singapura")

Sometime in its history, the name of Temasek was changed to Singapura. The
_[Sejarah Melayu](/wiki/Sejarah_Melayu "Sejarah Melayu")_ (_Malay Annals_)
contains a tale of a prince of Palembang, Sri Tri Buana (also known as [Sang
Nila Utama](/wiki/Sang_Nila_Utama "Sang Nila Utama")), who landed on Temasek
after surviving a storm in the 13th century. According to the tale, the prince
saw a strange creature, which he was told was a [lion](/wiki/Asiatic_lion
"Asiatic lion"). Believing this to be an auspicious sign, he founded a
settlement called Singapura, which means "Lion City" in
[Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit").[23]: 37, 88–92 [24]: 30–31 It is
unlikely there ever were lions in Singapore, though tigers continued to roam
the island until the early 20th century. However, the lion motif is common in
Hindu mythology, which was dominant in the region during that period (one of
the words for "throne" in the [Malay language](/wiki/Malay_language "Malay
language") is "singgasana", meaning "lion's seat" in Sanskrit), and it has
been speculated that the "Singapura" name, and the tale of the lion, were
invented by court historians of the [Malacca
Sultanate](/wiki/Malacca_Sultanate "Malacca Sultanate") to glorify Sang Nila
Utama and his line of descent.[25]

A divergent account is provided by Portuguese apothecary [Tome
Pires](/wiki/Tome_Pires "Tome Pires") in his _[Suma
Oriental](/wiki/Suma_Oriental "Suma Oriental")_ , composed shortly after the
[Portuguese conquest of Malacca](/wiki/Capture_of_Malacca_\(1511\) "Capture of
Malacca \(1511\)"). The Javanese source cited by Pires instead suggests that
Temasek was a Siamese vassal whose ruler, titled _Sang Aji_ , was killed by
[Parameswara](/wiki/Parameswara_of_Malacca "Parameswara of Malacca") from
Palembang in the late 14th century.[26] This Parameswara had fled to Temasek
from [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang "Palembang") after being deposed by the
[Majapahit Empire](/wiki/Majapahit_Empire "Majapahit Empire"), and violently
usurped the Sang Aji eight days after being welcomed into Temasek,
subsequently fleeing to [Muar](/wiki/Muar_\(town\) "Muar \(town\)"), then
[Malacca](/wiki/Malacca "Malacca") to escape retribution from the Siamese.[27]

Not withstanding the _Sejarah Melayu_ legend, the "Singapura" name possibly
dates to this period. Some argued that Singapura was named after the "lion
throne" Parameswara established in Palembang as a challenge to the Majapahit
empire, and for which he was expelled from Palembang.[28] Parameswara held the
island of Singapore for a number of years, until further attacks from either
the [Majapahit](/wiki/Majapahit_Empire "Majapahit Empire") or the [Ayutthaya
kingdom](/wiki/Ayutthaya_kingdom "Ayutthaya kingdom") in [Siam](/wiki/Siam
"Siam") forced him to move on to [Melaka](/wiki/Melaka "Melaka") where he
founded the [Sultanate of Malacca](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Malacca "Sultanate of
Malacca").[29] While there are parallels between the mythical Sang Nila Utama
and the historical Parameswara, they are regarded as distinct.[29]

### Malacca Sultanate

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Early_history_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=7
"Edit section: Malacca Sultanate")]

Archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on Fort Canning was
abandoned around this time, although a small trading settlement continued in
Singapore for some time afterwards.[28] Singapore became part of the Malacca
Sultanate, and it was said to be the [fiefdom](/wiki/Fiefdom "Fiefdom") of the
legendary [laksamana](/wiki/Laksamana "Laksamana") (or admiral) [Hang
Tuah](/wiki/Hang_Tuah "Hang Tuah").[30] However, by the time the Portuguese
arrived in the early 16th century, the Singapura that existed before Malacca
was founded had already become "great ruins" according to the conqueror of
Malacca [Afonso de Albuquerque](/wiki/Afonso_de_Albuquerque "Afonso de
Albuquerque").[31][32]

### Johor Sultanate

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Early_history_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=8
"Edit section: Johor Sultanate")]

After Albuquerque [captured Malacca in 1511](/wiki/Capture_of_Malacca_\(1511\)
"Capture of Malacca \(1511\)") for the [Portuguese colonial
empire](/wiki/Portuguese_colonial_empire "Portuguese colonial empire"), its
[laksamana](/wiki/Laksamana "Laksamana") fled to Singapore. In the 16th and
early 17th century, it briefly regained some significance as a trading centre
of the Malacca Sultanate's successor state in Johor whose Sultan kept a
_[shahbandar](/wiki/Shahbandar "Shahbandar")_ (harbourmaster) at
[Kallang](/wiki/Kallang "Kallang"). In 1603, the Johor Malays formed an
alliance with the Dutch and captured a Portuguese ship, the _[Santa
Catarina](/wiki/Santa_Catarina_\(ship\) "Santa Catarina \(ship\)")_ off the
east coast of Singapore; the looted porcelain came to be known as _[Kraak
ware](/wiki/Kraak_ware "Kraak ware")_ , and the arbitration over the legality
of the Dutch attack included [Hugo Grotius](/wiki/Hugo_Grotius "Hugo
Grotius")' treatise, the _[Mare Liberum](/wiki/Mare_Liberum "Mare Liberum")_ ,
widely considered to be the progentior of modern [maritime
law](/wiki/Maritime_law "Maritime law").[28]

The Portuguese destroyed the outpost in Singapore in 1613,[33][34] but shortly
afterwards in the early 1620s, it was suggested that forts be built in the
[Singapore Straits](/wiki/Singapore_Strait "Singapore Strait") to counter the
rising power of the Dutch.[28] Visitors to the area in the 17th century
mentioned that it was inhabited by the [Seletes](/wiki/Orang_Laut "Orang
Laut") who lived on water under the rule of Johor,[35] but Singapore had
largely sank into obscurity apart from a mention that [Singapore
River](/wiki/Singapore_River "Singapore River") was the location of a naval
battle between Johor and [Siak](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Siak_Sri_Indrapura
"Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura") in 1767.[28]

## Colonial period

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Early_history_of_Singapore&action=edit&section=9
"Edit section: Colonial period")]

[British East India Company](/wiki/British_East_India_Company "British East
India Company") employee [Sir Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Sir_Stamford_Raffles
"Sir Stamford Raffles"), former [Governor of the Dutch East
Indies](/wiki/List_of_governors_of_the_Dutch_East_Indies "List of governors of
the Dutch East Indies") during its British occupation and subsequent
[Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen](/wiki/Governors_of_Bencoolen "Governors of
Bencoolen"), established a British trading post on the island along with
[William Farquhar](/wiki/William_Farquhar "William Farquhar"). This was
spurred by the perceived need to establish a competitive port following the
retrocession of the [Dutch colonial empire](/wiki/Dutch_colonial_empire "Dutch
colonial empire") in the East Indies to the [Kingdom of
Holland](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Holland "Kingdom of Holland") after the [Napoleonic
Wars](/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars") had ended, which would have
left the British with their unprofitable settlements of
[Penang](/wiki/Penang#Colonial_Penang "Penang") and
[Bencoolen](/wiki/British_Bencoolen "British Bencoolen"). In his time as
Governor of the Dutch East Indies, Raffles had compiled _[The History of
Java](/wiki/The_History_of_Java "The History of Java")_ and had [John
Leyden](/wiki/John_Leyden "John Leyden") translate the _Sejarah Melayu_ ,
which he cites as an inspiration to claim Singapore in its introduction.

This [1819 Singapore Treaty](/wiki/1819_Singapore_Treaty "1819 Singapore
Treaty"), signed by himself, [Temenggong Abdul
Rahman](/wiki/Temenggong_Abdul_Rahman "Temenggong Abdul Rahman"), and Prince
[Hussein Long](/wiki/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor "Hussein Shah of Johor") whom he
declared to be the rightful [Sultan of Johor](/wiki/Sultan_of_Johor "Sultan of
Johor"), led to [its founding as a British
colony](/wiki/Founding_years_of_modern_Singapore "Founding years of modern
Singapore") under direct rule from the British East India Company following
the confirmation of its status as British colony (along with the founding of
[British Malaya](/wiki/British_Malaya "British Malaya") as a contiguous
polity) by the [Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824](/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Treaty_of_1824
"Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824"). This event has generally been understood to
mark the founding of colonial [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore "Singapore"), and
the beginning of its modern history.[36]
