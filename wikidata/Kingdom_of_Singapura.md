The **Kingdom of Singapura** ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language "Malay language"):
_Kerajaan Singapura_) was a [Malay](/wiki/Ethnic_Malays "Ethnic Malays")
[Hindu](/wiki/Hindu "Hindu")-[Buddhist](/wiki/Buddhist "Buddhist") kingdom
thought to have been established during the [early history of
Singapore](/wiki/Early_history_of_Singapore "Early history of Singapore") upon
its main island [Temasek](/wiki/Temasek "Temasek") from 1299 until its fall
sometime between 1396 and 1398.[2] Conventional view marks c. 1299 as the
founding year of the kingdom by [Sang Nila Utama](/wiki/Sang_Nila_Utama "Sang
Nila Utama") (also known as "Sri Tri Buana"), whose father is [Sang
Sapurba](/wiki/Sang_Sapurba "Sang Sapurba"), a semi-divine figure who
according to legend is the ancestor of several Malay monarchs in the [Malay
World](/wiki/Malay_World "Malay World").

The historicity of this kingdom based on the account given in the _[Malay
Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals "Malay Annals")_ is uncertain, and many historians
only consider its last ruler [Parameswara](/wiki/Parameswara_\(king\)
"Parameswara \(king\)") (or Sri Iskandar Shah) to be a historically attested
figure in his role as the first ruler of the [Malacca
Sultanate](/wiki/Malacca_Sultanate "Malacca Sultanate").[3] Archaeological
evidence from [Fort Canning Hill](/wiki/Fort_Canning_Hill "Fort Canning Hill")
and the nearby banks of the [Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River "Singapore
River") has nevertheless demonstrated the existence of a thriving settlement
and a trade port in the 14th century, corroborating the eyewitness testimony
of [Yuan dynasty](/wiki/Yuan_dynasty "Yuan dynasty") sojourner [Wang
Dayuan](/wiki/Wang_Dayuan "Wang Dayuan") concerning the settlements of [Long
Ya Men](/wiki/Long_Ya_Men "Long Ya Men") and [Ban Zu](/wiki/Ban_Zu "Ban Zu")
upon Temasek.[4]

The settlement developed in the 13th or 14th century and transformed from a
small trading outpost into a bustling center of international commerce,
facilitating trade networks that linked the [Malay
Archipelago](/wiki/Malay_Archipelago "Malay Archipelago"), India, and the
[Yuan dynasty](/wiki/Yuan_dynasty "Yuan dynasty"). It was however claimed by
two regional powers at that time, [Ayuthaya](/wiki/Ayutthaya_Kingdom
"Ayutthaya Kingdom") from the north and [Majapahit](/wiki/Majapahit
"Majapahit") from the south. As a result, the kingdom's fortified capital was
attacked by at least two major foreign invasions before it was finally sacked
by Majapahit in 1398 according to the _Malay Annals_ , or by the Siamese
according to Portuguese sources.[5][6][7] The last king, Parameswara, fled to
the west coast of the [Malay Peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula "Malay
Peninsula") to establish the [Malacca Sultanate](/wiki/Malacca_Sultanate
"Malacca Sultanate") in 1400.

## Etymology

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Singapura&action=edit&section=1 "Edit
section: Etymology")]

Main article: [Names of Singapore § Etymology of
Singapore](/wiki/Names_of_Singapore#Etymology_of_Singapore "Names of
Singapore")

The name _Singapura_ is derived from [Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit_Language
"Sanskrit Language") meaning "Lion City".[8] _Singa_ comes from the Sanskrit
word _siṃha_ , which means "lion", and _pūra_ means "city" in Sanskrit.[9]
According to the _[Malay Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals "Malay Annals")_ , [Sang
Nila Utama](/wiki/Sang_Nila_Utama "Sang Nila Utama") and his men were
exploring Tanjong Bemban while in [Bintan](/wiki/Bintan "Bintan") when he
spotted an island with white sandy beach from a high point. On learning that
the island was called [Temasek](/wiki/Temasek "Temasek"), they set sail for
the island, but encountered a severe storm on the way. After they managed to
land safely on the island, they went to hunt for wild animals. He suddenly saw
a strange animal with a red body, black head and a white neck breast. It was a
fine-looking animal and moved with great speed as it disappeared into the
jungle. He asked his chief minister, Demang Lebar Daun, what animal it was,
and was told that it probably was an [Asiatic lion](/wiki/Asiatic_lion
"Asiatic lion"). He then decided to stay in Temasek, named the city he founded
Singapura or "Lion City".[10][11]

Some scholars believe that Sang Nila Utama and the story of its founding to be
fictional, and a number of alternative suggestions for the origin of the name
of Singapore have been given. For example, it has been proposed that the name
Singapura was adopted by [Parameswara](/wiki/Parameswara_\(king\) "Parameswara
\(king\)") as an indication that he was re-establishing in Temasek the lion
throne that he had originally set up in [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang
"Palembang") as a challenge to the Javanese [Majapahit
Empire](/wiki/Majapahit_Empire "Majapahit Empire").[12] In this version of
events, Parameswara had assassinated the local ruler of Temasek and usurped
the throne, and changed the name of Temasek to strengthen the legitimacy of
his claim over the island.[8] Others linked the name to the Javanese kingdom
of [Singhasari](/wiki/Singhasari "Singhasari") as well as a Majapahit Buddhist
sect whose adherents were referred to as lions. Although it is believed that
the name Singapura replaced Temasek some time in the 14th century, the origin
of the name cannot be determined with certainty.[12]

"Egnazio Danti") showing _Cingatola_ as an island located on the tip of _Regio
di Malaca_.

The only comprehensive account of Singapore's history in this era is the
_[Malay Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals "Malay Annals")_. These were written and
compiled during the height of the [Malacca Sultanate](/wiki/Malacca_Sultanate
"Malacca Sultanate") and re-compiled in 1612 by the court of the [Johor
Sultanate](/wiki/Johor_Sultanate "Johor Sultanate"). It is the basis for
accounts of its founding, the succession of rulers and its decline. As no
specific date is given in the _Malay Annals_ , the chronology of the history
of the Kingdom of Singapura as set out in the _Malay Annals_ is calculated
from the date of death of Parameswara given in the _[Ming Veritable
Records](/wiki/Ming_Veritable_Records "Ming Veritable Records")_.[1] While
various aspects of the accounts of the Malacca and Johor sultanates given in
the _Malay Annals_ are relatively accurate, the same can not be said for the
Kingdom of Singapura for which there is little corroborating evidence for
large part of its accounts. Historians are therefore generally in doubt over
the historicity of the kingdom as described in the semi-historical _Malay
Annals_ ,[3][13] nevertheless some consider Singapura to be a significant
polity that existed between the decline of [Srivijaya](/wiki/Srivijaya
"Srivijaya") and the rise of Malacca.[14][15] Some also argued that the author
of the _Malay Annals_ , whose purpose is to legitimise the claim of descent
from the Palembang ruling house, invented the five kings of Singapura to gloss
over an inglorious period of its history.[12] However, Iskandar
Shah/Parameswara, the last ruler of Singapura and founder of the Malacca
Sultanate, is a figure that could be considered factual.[12]

Accounts of Singapura in its final years are also briefly given in Portuguese
sources, such as those by [Tomé Pires](/wiki/Tom%C3%A9_Pires "Tomé Pires"),
Brás de Albuquerque (who published letters by his father [Afonso de
Albuquerque](/wiki/Afonso_de_Albuquerque "Afonso de Albuquerque")), [Godinho
de Erédia](/wiki/Godinho_de_Er%C3%A9dia "Godinho de Erédia"), and [João de
Barros](/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_de_Barros "João de Barros").[16] For example, the
_[Suma Oriental](/wiki/Suma_Oriental "Suma Oriental")_ , written shortly after
the [Portuguese conquest of Malacca](/wiki/Capture_of_Malacca_\(1511\)
"Capture of Malacca \(1511\)"), briefly mentions Singapura in relation to the
foundation of Malacca. Both the _Suma Oriental_ and the _Malay Annals_ contain
similar stories about a fleeing Palembang prince who arrived and lay claim to
Singapura, and about the last king of Singapura who fled to the west coast of
the [Malay Peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula "Malay Peninsula") to found
Malacca. However, both accounts differ markedly as the _Suma Oriental_
identifies the fleeing prince and the last king of Singapura as Parameswara.
In contrast, the _Malay Annals_ identifies the fleeing prince and the last
king as two different people separated by five generations, [Sang Nila
Utama](/wiki/Sang_Nila_Utama "Sang Nila Utama") and [Iskandar
Shah](/wiki/Iskandar_Shah "Iskandar Shah") respectively. The _Suma Oriental_
noted further that the fleeing Palembang prince assassinated the local ruler
"Temagi" or "Sang Aji" and usurped the throne of Singapura sometimes around
the 1390s, and Parameswara then ruled Singapura for five years with the help
of the _Çelates_ or [Orang Laut](/wiki/Orang_Laut "Orang Laut").[17]

Portuguese sources named Iskandar Shah as Parameswara's son, Chinese [Ming
dynasty](/wiki/Ming_dynasty "Ming dynasty") sources similar named Iskandar
Shah as the second ruler of Malacca. Many modern scholars believe Parameswara
to be the same person as Iskandar Shah, and some scholars argued that they
were mistaken as two different people due to Parameswara changing his name to
Iskandar Shah after he converted to Islam.[18][19] There are however other
opinions, and many now accept [Megat Iskandar Shah](/wiki/Megat_Iskandar_Shah
"Megat Iskandar Shah") as the son of Parameswara.[20]

The only first-hand account of 14th-century Singapore may be the descriptions
of a place named _Danmaxi_ (generally identified with Temasek) written by
[Wang Dayuan](/wiki/Wang_Dayuan "Wang Dayuan") in the _[Daoyi
Zhilüe](/wiki/Daoyi_Zhil%C3%BCe "Daoyi Zhilüe")_ , a record of his travels. It
indicates that Temasek was ruled by a local chief during Wang's visit around
1330,[21] however the word used (酋長, "tribal chief") by Wang indicates that
the ruler may not have been independent, rather he was a vassal of another
more powerful state.[22] Wang also mentioned that the Siamese attacked the
fortified city of Temasek with around 70 ships a few years before he visited,
but Temasek successfully resisted the attack which lasted a month.[17] Other
settlements on the island recorded by Wang are [Long Ya Men](/wiki/Long_Ya_Men
"Long Ya Men") (identified with [Keppel Harbour](/wiki/Keppel_Harbour "Keppel
Harbour")) and [Ban Zu](/wiki/Ban_Zu "Ban Zu") (possibly a transcription of
_Pancur_ , or a sacred spring on [Fort Canning Hill](/wiki/Fort_Canning_Hill
"Fort Canning Hill")); the exact relationship between these settlements is
unclear.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed

### Archaeological evidence

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Singapura&action=edit&section=3 "Edit
section: Archaeological evidence")]

Main article: [Archaeology in Singapore](/wiki/Archaeology_in_Singapore
"Archaeology in Singapore")

Although the existence of the kingdom as described in the _Malay Annals_ is
debatable, archaeological excavations on [Fort Canning](/wiki/Fort_Canning
"Fort Canning") and its vicinity along the banks of the [Singapore
River](/wiki/Singapore_River "Singapore River") since 1984 by [John
Miksic](/wiki/John_N._Miksic "John N. Miksic") have confirmed the presence of
a thriving settlement and a trade port there during the 14th century.[23]
Remnants of a wall of significant size (described by [John
Crawfurd](/wiki/John_Crawfurd "John Crawfurd") as around five metres wide and
three metres high) and unique to the region were found inland along present
day [Stamford Road](/wiki/Stamford_Road "Stamford Road"). Excavations also
found evidence of structures built on what is now [Fort Canning
Hill](/wiki/Fort_Canning_Hill "Fort Canning Hill"), along with evidence of
fruit orchards and terraces. Local lore when the British arrived in the early
1800s associated it with the royalty of ancient Singapura where its last ruler
was buried, and the hill was known to them as the Forbidden Hill (_Bukit
Larangan_), as it was the site of spirits. In 1928, a cache of gold ornaments
was found by workers excavating the hill for the [Fort Canning
Reservoir](/wiki/Fort_Canning_Reservoir "Fort Canning Reservoir"), including a
pair of near-identical flexible armlets, a finger ring inscribed with a bird-
like motif, three pairs of circular rings (perhaps earrings), an elliptical
ornament, and a jewelled clasp with a disc-and-conch motif.[24] Most of these
were lost during the [Japanese occupation of
Singapore](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore "Japanese occupation of
Singapore") in the Second World War, and only one of the armbands and two of
the circular rings remain.[25][26] Numerous fragments of ceramics, porcelain,
and other objects have been found at three different locations around the
Singapore River and Fort Canning Hill, with those from Fort Canning Hill of a
higher quality than the others, offering further evidence that it was the
residence of the elites, all of which supports the notion that Singapore was a
political and commercial center in the 14th century.[4]

of Sang Nila Utama at the [Raffles' Landing
Site](/wiki/Raffles%27_Landing_Site "Raffles' Landing Site").

According to the _[Malay Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals "Malay Annals")_ , a
fleeing Palembang prince named [Sang Nila Utama](/wiki/Sang_Nila_Utama "Sang
Nila Utama"), who claimed to be a descendant of [Alexander the
Great](/wiki/Alexander_the_Great "Alexander the Great") (via his Islamic
interpretation as [Iskandar Zulkarnain](/wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn "Dhul-Qarnayn")),
took refuge on [Bintan Island](/wiki/Bintan_Island "Bintan Island") for
several years before he set sail and landed on Temasek in 1299.[31] In this
era, Temasek was a small trading outpost and primarily inhabited by [Orang
Laut](/wiki/Orang_Laut "Orang Laut") seafarers. Historically, these Orang Laut
were very loyal to the Malay kings, patrolling adjacent seas and repelling
other petty pirates, directing traders to their Malay overlords' ports and
maintaining those ports' dominance in the area.[32] These Orang Laut
eventually declared him _[Raja](/wiki/Raja "Raja")_ ("king"), and Sang Nila
Utama renamed Temasek as "Singapura" and founded his capital around the mouth
of the [Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River "Singapore River").[33]

The area was suitable for a new settlement due to the nearby presence of a
spring and a hill. The fresh water from a spring on the hill's slope served
both as a bathing place for royalty and, at the base of a hill, a source of
fresh water for the populace. The hill (modern-day [Fort Canning
Hill](/wiki/Fort_Canning_Hill "Fort Canning Hill")) itself represented [Mount
Meru](/wiki/Mount_Meru "Mount Meru"), the seat of the gods in Hindu-Buddhist
mythology, which was associated with kingship and divinity in ancient
Southeast Asian culture. Building a palace on a hill would have helped Sang
Nila Utama to assert his role as a semi-divine ruler.[34]

The king styled himself as Sri Tri Buana, or "The Lord of Three Worlds",
indicating authority over the universe.[35] Within a few decades, the small
settlement grew into a thriving cosmopolitan city serving as a port of call
for richly laden trade ships traveling through the [Malacca
Straits](/wiki/Strait_of_Malacca "Strait of Malacca") region. The _Malay
Annals_ mention that supplies of workers, horses and elephants were sent from
Bintan by the king's adoptive mother, Queen Parameswari of Bintan.[_[citation
needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

It was during this period that contacts with Yuan dynasty China were
established. It was recorded that in 1320, [Yuan](/wiki/Yuan_dynasty "Yuan
dynasty") China sent envoys to _[Long Ya Men](/wiki/Long_Ya_Men "Long Ya
Men")_ (thought by some to stretch from modern-day [Keppel
Harbour](/wiki/Keppel_Harbour "Keppel Harbour") south to the northwestern side
of [Sentosa](/wiki/Sentosa "Sentosa") and west to what is today the [Labrador
Nature Reserve](/wiki/Labrador_Nature_Reserve "Labrador Nature Reserve")) "to
obtain tame elephants", and the natives of _Long Ya Men_ returned with
tributes and a trade mission to China in 1325.[36]

_Long Ya Men_ was part of [Temasek](/wiki/Temasek "Temasek") (the Kingdom of
Singapura) according to Chinese traveler [Wang Dayuan](/wiki/Wang_Dayuan "Wang
Dayuan") who visited Temasek in the 1330s and wrote an account of his travel
in the _[Daoyi Zhilüe](/wiki/Daoyi_Zhil%C3%BCe "Daoyi Zhilüe")_. He describes
Temasek as comprising two settlements – "[Ban Zu](/wiki/Ban_Zu "Ban Zu")"
(after the Malay word "pancur" or fresh-water spring), a peaceful trading port
city under the rule of the king. The second settlement he describes as an area
surrounding the "[Long-ya-men](/wiki/Long_Ya_Men "Long Ya Men")", which was
occupied by ferocious pirates who launched frequent attacks on passing
merchant ships. He also notes that Chinese traders lived there, "side by side
with the natives". He also mentions some of the trade goods bartered in
Singapura: red gold, cotton prints, blue satin, [lakawood](/wiki/Lakawood
"Lakawood") and fine hornbill casques.[37][38]

The [Siamese](/wiki/Siam "Siam") attempted to subjugate the island kingdom in
this period. According to Wang's account, possibly a few years before he
visited Temasek in the 1330s, a Siamese fleet consisting of 70 junks descended
upon the island kingdom and launched an attack. The moated and heavily
fortified city managed to withstand the siege of the Siamese for a month until
the Siamese fleet withdrew with the arrival of a [Yuan
dynasty](/wiki/Yuan_dynasty "Yuan dynasty") imperial envoy.[39][6][17]

In 1347, Sri Teri Buana was succeeded by [Sri Wikrama
Wira](/wiki/Sri_Wikrama_Wira "Sri Wikrama Wira"). The increasingly powerful
Javanese kingdom of Majapahit, the successor of [Singhasari](/wiki/Singhasari
"Singhasari"), began eyeing the growing influence of the tiny island kingdom.
Under the leadership of its ambitious warlord, [Gajah Mada](/wiki/Gajah_Mada
"Gajah Mada"), Majapahit started to embark on overseas expansions against all
kingdoms of the [Malay Archipelago](/wiki/Malay_Archipelago "Malay
Archipelago"). In 1350, [Hayam Wuruk](/wiki/Hayam_Wuruk "Hayam Wuruk")
ascended to the throne of Majapahit. The new king sent an envoy to Singapura
demanding the submission of the kingdom. Wikrama Wira refused to do so and
even sent a symbolic message threatening to shave the Majapahit king's head
should he proceed to Singapura.[40]

The furious Majapahit king ordered an invasion with a fleet of 100 main
warships ([jong](/wiki/Djong_\(ship\) "Djong \(ship\)")) and many smaller
vessels under the command of Damang Wiraja.[40][41] The fleet passed through
the island of Bintan, from where the news spread to Singapura. The defenders
immediately assembled 400 warboats to face the invasion. Both sides clashed on
the coast of Singapura in a battle that took place over three days and three
nights. Many were killed on both sides and in the evening of the third day,
the Javanese were driven back to their ships.[42][43][44]

Sri Wikrama Wira died in 1362 and succeeded by his son, [Sri Rana
Wikrama](/wiki/Sri_Rana_Wikrama "Sri Rana Wikrama"). Despite the failure in
the previous campaign, the Javanese chronicle
_[Nagarakretagama](/wiki/Nagarakretagama "Nagarakretagama")_ lists Singapura
as a subject of Majapahit in 1365. During his reign, Sri Rana Wikrama
established a diplomatic ties with a Sumatran [Peureulak
Sultanate](/wiki/Peureulak_Sultanate "Peureulak Sultanate").[5] It was during
the reign of Sri Rana Wikrama that, the legendary [Badang](/wiki/Badang

Wikrama's court, including casting the [Singapore Stone](/wiki/Singapore_Stone

Maharaja](/wiki/Sri_Maharaja "Sri Maharaja"). According to the _Malay Annals_
, the reign of Sri Maharaja was marked with the event of _todak_
([garfish](/wiki/Needlefish "Needlefish")) ravaging the coast of Singapura. A
young boy, [Hang Nadim](/wiki/Hang_Nadim "Hang Nadim"), thought of an
ingenious solution to fend off the _todak_ by planting banana plants along the
shoreline, where they would get stuck whilst leaping out of the water. The
king was initially grateful, but felt increasingly envious of the attention
the boy's intelligence was garnering, and ordered to have the boy
executed.[46]

In 1387, Paduka Sri Maharaja was succeeded by Iskandar Shah, commonly

\(king\)") mentioned in the _[Suma Oriental](/wiki/Suma_Oriental "Suma
Oriental")_ of [Tomé Pires](/wiki/Tom%C3%A9_Pires "Tomé Pires"). Based on his
Persian name and title, it is believed that Iskandar Shah was the first king
of Singapura to embrace Islam. Portuguese accounts by Pires however, suggested
that the Iskandar Shah mentioned in his text (and said to be Parameswara's
son) only converted when he was 72 as the ruler of Malacca.[18]

#### Fall of Singapura and establishment of Malacca

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Singapura&action=edit&section=10 "Edit
section: Fall of Singapura and establishment of Malacca")]

As mentioned in the _Malay Annals_ , the story of the fall of Singapura and
the flight of its last king begins with Iskandar Shah's accusing one of his
[concubines](/wiki/Concubine "Concubine") of adultery. As punishment, the king
had her stripped naked in public. In revenge, the concubine's father, Sang
Rajuna Tapa who was also an official in Iskandar Shah's court, secretly sent a
message to the king of Majapahit, pledging his support should the king choose
to invade Singapura. In 1398, Majapahit dispatched a fleet of 300 jong and
hundreds of smaller vessels (of [kelulus](/wiki/Kelulus "Kelulus"),
[pelang](/wiki/Pelang "Pelang"), and [jongkong](/wiki/Jongkong "Jongkong")),
carrying no fewer than 200,000 men.[47][48][49]

The Javanese soldiers engaged with the defenders in a battle outside the
fortress, before forcing them to retreat behind the walls. The invasion force
laid siege to the city and repeatedly tried to attack the fortress. However
the fortress proved to be impregnable.[5][6][50] After about a month passed,
the food in the fortress began to run low and the defenders were on the verge
of starvation. Sang Rajuna Tapa was then asked to distribute whatever grain
left to the people from the royal store. Seeing this opportunity for revenge,
the minister lied to the King, saying the stores were empty. The grain was not
distributed and the people eventually starved. The final assault came when the
gates were finally opened under the order of the minister. Knowing that defeat
was imminent, Iskandar Shah and his followers fled the island. The Majapahit
soldiers rushed into the fortress and a terrible massacre ensued.[51]
According to the _Malay Annals_ , "blood flowed like a river" and the red
stains on the laterite soil of Singapore are said to be blood from that
massacre.[52][53]

Portuguese sources give a significantly different account of the life of last
ruler of Singapura. These accounts named the last ruler of Singapura and
founder of Malacca as Parameswara, a name also found in Ming annals. It is
generally believed that the Iskandar Shah of the _Malay Annals_ is the same
person as Parameswara.[12] However, Portuguese accounts and Ming sources
indicate that Iskandar Shah was the son of Parameswara who became the second
ruler of Malacca,[16] and some therefore argued that [Megat Iskandar
Shah](/wiki/Megat_Iskandar_Shah_of_Malacca "Megat Iskandar Shah of Malacca")
was the son of Parameswara.[20] According to the Portuguese accounts,
Parameswara was a prince from [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang "Palembang") who
attempted to challenge Javanese rule over Palembang sometime after 1360. The
Javanese then attacked and drove Parameswara out of Palembang. Parameswara
escaped to Singapura, and was welcomed by its ruler of with the title Sang Aji
named Sangesinga. Parameswara assassinated the local ruler after 8 days, then
ruled Singapura for five years with the help of the _Çelates_ or [Orang
Laut](/wiki/Orang_Laut "Orang Laut").[17] He was however driven out by the
Thais, possibly as a punishment for killing the Sang Aji whose wife may have
been from the Kingdom of [Patani](/wiki/Pattani_Kingdom "Pattani
Kingdom").[54]

## Administration

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Singapura&action=edit&section=12 "Edit
section: Administration")]

The _[Malay Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals "Malay Annals")_ provide a well-defined
hierarchical structure of Singapura, which was later partly adopted by its
successor, Malacca. The highest hierarchical position was the _Raja_ (king) as
an absolute monarch. Next to the _Raja_ were the _Orang Besar Berempat_ (four
senior nobles) headed by a _[Bendahara](/wiki/Bendahara "Bendahara")_
(equivalent to a Grand Vizier) as the highest-ranking officer and the advisor
to the King. He was then assisted by three other senior nobles based on the
order of precedence namely; _Perdana Menteri_ (prime minister), _Penghulu
Bendahari_ (chief of treasurer) and _Hulubalang Besar_ (grand
commander).[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed
"Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The _Perdana Menteri_ assisted the _Bendahara_ in administering the internal
affairs of the kingdom and usually sat opposite to the _Bendahara_ in the
royal court, while the _Penghulu Bendahari_ was responsible for the financial
affairs of the kingdom.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed

The _Hulubalang Besar_ acted as a chief of staff of the army and commanded
several other [Hulubalangs](/wiki/Hulubalang "Hulubalang") (commanders), who
in turn led smaller military units. The _Orang Besar Berempat_ were assisted
by other lower ranking officials titled _Orang Besar Caterias_ , _Sida
Bentaras_ and _Orang Kayas_.[55]

armband with _[singhamukha](/wiki/Simhamukha "Simhamukha")_ and two of the
circular ornaments, probably dating to the 14th-century, found in 1928 at
[Fort Canning Hill](/wiki/Fort_Canning_Hill "Fort Canning Hill"),
Singapore.[30]

Singapura's rise as a trade-post was concurrent with the era known as [Pax
Mongolica](/wiki/Pax_Mongolica "Pax Mongolica"), where the [Mongol
Empire](/wiki/Mongol_Empire "Mongol Empire")'s influence over both the
overland and maritime [silk roads](/wiki/Silk_road "Silk road") allowed a new
global trading system to develop. Previously, shipping occurred on long-
distance routes from the [Far East](/wiki/Far_East "Far East") to
[India](/wiki/History_of_India "History of India") or even further west to the
[Arabian Peninsula](/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula "Arabian Peninsula"), which was
relatively costly, risky and time-consuming. However, the new trading system
involved the division of the maritime silk road into three segments: an
[Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean") sector linking the [Gulf of
Aden](/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden "Gulf of Aden") and the [Strait of
Hormuz](/wiki/Strait_of_Hormuz "Strait of Hormuz")-based Arab traders to
India, a [Bay of Bengal](/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal "Bay of Bengal") sector linking
the Indian ports with the [Strait of Malacca](/wiki/Strait_of_Malacca "Strait
of Malacca") and its associated ports including Singapura and the [South China
Sea](/wiki/South_China_Sea "South China Sea") sector linking [Southeast
Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia "Southeast Asia") with [Southern
China](/wiki/Southern_China "Southern China").[56]

Singapura achieved its significance due to its role as a [port](/wiki/Port
"Port"). It seems to fit – at least in part – the definition of a port of
trade in which trade is less a function of the economy and more a function of
government policy; thus trading would have been highly structured and
institutionalized, with government agents playing key roles in port
activities. Portuguese traders' account in particular, suggest that Singapura
operated in such a manner. Reports from merchants of different countries also
indicate that Singapura was a point of exchange, rather than a source for
goods. Local products were limited in type and mainly consisted of
[lakawood](/wiki/Lakawood "Lakawood"), [tin](/wiki/Tin "Tin"),
[hornbill](/wiki/Hornbill "Hornbill") casques (an [ivory](/wiki/Ivory
"Ivory")-like part of the hornbill bird, which was valued for carved
ornaments), some wooden items and cotton. Other commonly traded products
included a variety of [fabrics](/wiki/Fabric "Fabric") ([cotton](/wiki/Cotton
"Cotton") and [satins](/wiki/Satin "Satin")), [iron rods](/wiki/Wrought_iron
"Wrought iron"), iron pots, and [porcelains](/wiki/Porcelain "Porcelain").
Chinese traders also reported that there were very few agricultural products
due to poor soil. Although these goods were also available from other
Southeast Asian ports, those from Singapura were unique in terms of their
quality. Singapura also acted as a gateway into the regional and international
economic system for its immediate region. [South Johor](/wiki/Johor "Johor")
and the [Riau Archipelago](/wiki/Riau_Archipelago "Riau Archipelago") supplied
products to Singapura for export elsewhere, while Singapura was the main
source of foreign products to the region. Archaeological artefacts such as
[ceramics](/wiki/Ceramic "Ceramic") and [glassware](/wiki/Glassware
"Glassware") found in the Riau Archipelago are evidence of this. In addition,
cotton was [transshipped](/wiki/Transshipment "Transshipment") from Java or
India through Singapura.[57]

The increase in activities by Chinese traders seems especially significant for
Singapura and its trade. Wang Dayuan indicated that, by this time, there was a
Chinese settlement in Singapura living peaceably with the indigenous
population.[58]

## Legacy

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Singapura&action=edit&section=14 "Edit
section: Legacy")]

> _"... have the honour of mixing with those of ashes of Malayan kings ..."_

— Sir [Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles "Stamford Raffles"), the
founder of the [British colony of
Singapore](/wiki/Founding_years_of_modern_Singapore "Founding years of modern
Singapore"), on his desire to be buried upon [Fort Canning
Hill](/wiki/Fort_Canning_Hill "Fort Canning Hill") were he to pass away in
Singapore[59]

According to the _Malay Annals_ , after sacking Singapura, the Majapahit army
abandoned the city and returned to Java. The city would have been ruined and
greatly depopulated. The rivalry between the courts of the Javanese and Malay
in the region was renewed a few years later when the last king Iskandar Shah,
founded his new stronghold on the mouth of [Bertam River](/wiki/Malacca_River
"Malacca River") on the west coast of the [Malay
Peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula "Malay Peninsula"). Within decades, the new
city grew rapidly to become the capital of [Malacca
Sultanate](/wiki/Malacca_Sultanate "Malacca Sultanate") and emerged as the
primary base in continuing the historic struggles of Singapura against their
Java-based rivals. The account by João de Barros suggests that Singapura did
not end suddenly after the attack by the Siamese, rather Singapore declined
gradually when Parameswara's son Iskandar Shah pushed for trade to move to
Malacca instead of Singapura.[60]

As a major entrepot, Malacca attracted Muslim traders from various part of the
world and became a centre of Islam, spreading the religion throughout
[Maritime Southeast Asia](/wiki/Maritime_Southeast_Asia "Maritime Southeast
Asia"). The expansion of Islam into interior Java in the 15th century led to
the gradual decline of Hindu-Majapahit before it finally succumbed to the
emerging local Muslim forces in the early 16th century. The period spanning
from Malaccan era right until the age of [European
colonisation](/wiki/History_of_Southeast_Asia#European_colonisation "History
of Southeast Asia"), saw the domination of Malay-Muslim sultanates in trade
and politics that eventually contributed to the
[Malayisation](/wiki/Malayisation "Malayisation") of the region.[61]

By the mid-15th century, Majapahit found itself unable to control the rising
power of Malacca as it began to gain effective control of the [Strait of
Malacca](/wiki/Strait_of_Malacca "Strait of Malacca") and expand its influence
to Sumatra. Singapura was also absorbed into its realm and once served as the
[fiefdom](/wiki/Fiefdom "Fiefdom") of a Melaccan [Laksamana](/wiki/Laksamana
"Laksamana").[62] The [Johor Sultanate](/wiki/Johor_Sultanate "Johor
Sultanate") emerged as the dominant power around the Straits of Singapore
until it was assimilated into the sphere of influence of the [Dutch East India
Company](/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company "Dutch East India Company"); the
island of Singapore would not regain autonomy from Johor until Sir [Stamford
Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles "Stamford Raffles") claimed it and its port
for the [British East India Company](/wiki/British_East_India_Company "British
East India Company") in 1819, deliberately invoking its history as related in
the _Malay Annals_ ,[63] whose translation by Dr. [John
Leyden](/wiki/John_Leyden "John Leyden") he posthumously published in
1821.[64] The dispute concerning Singapore's legal status, along with other
matters arising from British seizure of Dutch colonial possessions during the
[Napoleonic Wars](/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars"), was settled by the
[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824](/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Treaty_of_1824 "Anglo-Dutch
Treaty of 1824"), permanently dividing archipelagic and mainland Southeast
Asia.

The independent [Republic of Singapore](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore "Republic
of Singapore"), following the confirmation of its past as the Kingdom of
Singapura through its archaeology, has promoted Singapura's history as a
regional emporium, showcasing it in the Maritime Experiential Museum on
[Sentosa](/wiki/Sentosa "Sentosa")[65] and incorporating the chronicle of Sang
Nila Utama into its primary school social sciences curriculum.[66] As part of
events commemorating the bicentennial of Raffles' claim to Singapore, a statue
of Sang Nila Utama has been erected (along with those of other Singaporean
pioneers contemporary with Raffles) at the [Raffles' Landing
Site](/wiki/Raffles%27_Landing_Site "Raffles' Landing Site") along the
[Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River "Singapore River"), which the Kingdom
of Singapura was built upon.[67]
