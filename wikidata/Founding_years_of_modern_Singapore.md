The establishment of a British trading post in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore
"Singapore") in 1819 by [Sir Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles
"Stamford Raffles") led to its founding as a [British
colony](/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") in 1824. This event has
generally been understood to mark the founding of colonial
[Singapore](/wiki/Singapore "Singapore"),[1] a break from its status as a port
in ancient times during the [Srivijaya](/wiki/Srivijaya "Srivijaya") and
[Majapahit](/wiki/Majapahit "Majapahit") eras, and later, as part of the
[Sultanate of Malacca](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Malacca "Sultanate of Malacca") and
the [Johor Sultanate](/wiki/Johor_Sultanate "Johor Sultanate").

## Pre-colonial Singapore

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Founding_years_of_modern_Singapore&action=edit&section=1
"Edit section: Pre-colonial Singapore")]

Main article: [Early history of Singapore](/wiki/Early_history_of_Singapore
"Early history of Singapore")

A significant port and settlement, known as [Temasek](/wiki/Temasek
"Temasek"), later renamed [Singapura](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura "Kingdom of
Singapura"), existed on the island of Singapore in the 14th century.
[Vietnamese](/wiki/Vietnam "Vietnam") records indicate possible diplomatic
relationship between Temasek and Vietnam in the 13th century,[2] and Chinese
documents describe settlements there in the 14th century.[3] It was likely a
[vassal state](/wiki/Vassal_state "Vassal state") of both the
[Majapahit](/wiki/Majapahit "Majapahit") Empire and the
[Siamese](/wiki/Ayutthaya_Kingdom "Ayutthaya Kingdom") at different times in
the 14th century.[4] Around the end of the 14th century, its ruler
[Parameswara](/wiki/Parameswara_\(king\) "Parameswara \(king\)") was attacked
by either the [Majapahit](/wiki/Majapahit "Majapahit") or the
[Siamese](/wiki/Thailand "Thailand"), forcing him to move on to
[Melaka](/wiki/Melaka "Melaka") where he founded the [Sultanate of
Malacca](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Malacca "Sultanate of Malacca"),[5] Archaeological
evidence suggests that the main settlement on present-day [Fort
Canning](/wiki/Fort_Canning "Fort Canning") was abandoned around this time,
although a small-scale trading settlement continued in Singapore for some time
afterwards.[6] Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the Malay archipelago was
gradually taken over by the [European](/wiki/Europe "Europe") [colonial
powers](/wiki/Colonialism "Colonialism"), beginning with the
[Portuguese](/wiki/Portugal "Portugal") conquest of the [Malacca
Sultanate](/wiki/Malacca_Sultanate "Malacca Sultanate") in 1511. In 1613, the
Portuguese burnt down a trading settlement at the mouth of the [Singapore
River](/wiki/Singapore_River "Singapore River"), after which Singapore lapsed
into insignificance in the history of the region for two hundred years.[7]

The early dominance of the Portuguese was challenged during the 17th century
by the Dutch, who came to control most of the region's ports. The Dutch
established a monopoly over trade within the archipelago, particularly in
spices, then the region's most important product. Other colonial powers,
including the British, were limited to a relatively minor presence in that
period.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation
needed")_]

Singapore's name comes from 'Singa Pura' which means Lion City in
[Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit"). According to the Sejarah Melayu (Malay
Annals), a [Sumatran](/wiki/Sumatra "Sumatra") prince called [Sang Nila
Utama](/wiki/Sang_Nila_Utama "Sang Nila Utama") landed on Temasek[8]
(Singapore's old name) and saw a [Lion](/wiki/Lion "Lion") which is called
'Singa' in Malay. Thus he gave the [island](/wiki/Island "Island") a new name,
'Singapura'.[9]

## Raffles' landing and arrival

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Founding_years_of_modern_Singapore&action=edit&section=2
"Edit section: Raffles' landing and arrival")]

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/StamfordRaffles.jpeg/170px-
StamfordRaffles.jpeg)](/wiki/File:StamfordRaffles.jpeg)Sir Stamford Raffles,
founder of modern Singapore

In 1818, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles was appointed Lieutenant Governor of [the
British colony at Bencoolen](/wiki/Bencoolen_Presidency "Bencoolen
Presidency"). Raffles believed that the British should find a way to challenge
the dominance of the Dutch in the area. The trade route between China and
[British India](/wiki/British_India "British India") passed through the
[Malacca Strait](/wiki/Malacca_Strait "Malacca Strait"), and with the growing
trade with [China](/wiki/China "China"), that route would become increasingly
important. However, the Dutch had tight control over the trade in the region
and intended to enforce the exclusive rights of its company ships to trade,
and that trade should be conducted at its entrepot
[Batavia](/wiki/Batavia,_Dutch_East_Indies "Batavia, Dutch East Indies").
British trading ships were heavily taxed at Dutch ports, stifling British
trade in the region.[10][11]

Raffles reasoned that the way to challenge the Dutch was to establish a new
port in the region. Existing [British](/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom")
ports were not in a strategic enough position to become major trading centres.
[Penang](/wiki/Penang "Penang") was too far north of the southern narrow part
of [Straits of Malacca](/wiki/Straits_of_Malacca "Straits of Malacca")
controlled by the Dutch, whereas [Bencoolen](/wiki/British_Bencoolen "British
Bencoolen") faced the [Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean") near
the [Sunda Strait](/wiki/Sunda_Strait "Sunda Strait"), a much less important
area as it is too far away from the main trading route.[12]

In 1818, Raffles managed to convince [Lord Hastings](/wiki/Francis_Rawdon-
Hastings,_1st_Marquess_of_Hastings "Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of
Hastings"), the then [governor-general](/wiki/Governor-general "Governor-
general") of India and his superior in the [British East India
Company](/wiki/British_East_India_Company "British East India Company"), to
fund an expedition to establish a new British base in the region, but with the
proviso that it should not antagonise the Dutch.[11]

Raffles settled on the island of Singapore because of its position at the
southern tip of the Malay peninsula, near the Straits of Malacca, and its
excellent natural harbor, fresh water supplies, and timber for repairing
ships. Most importantly, it was unoccupied by the Dutch.[11]

Raffles' expedition arrived in Singapore on 29 January 1819 (although they
landed on [Saint John's Island](/wiki/Saint_John%27s_Island "Saint John's
Island") the previous day).[13] He found a
[Malay](/wiki/Malays_\(ethnic_group\) "Malays \(ethnic group\)") settlement at
the mouth of the [Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River "Singapore River"),
headed by [Temenggong Abdul Rahman](/wiki/Temenggong_Abdul_Rahman "Temenggong
Abdul Rahman") for the Sultan of [Johor](/wiki/Johor "Johor"). The Temenggong
had originally moved to Singapore from [Johor](/wiki/Johor "Johor") in 1811
with a group of Malays, and when Raffles arrived, there were an estimated 150
people governed by the Temenggong, most of them Malays, with around 30
Chinese.[14] Although the island was nominally ruled by Johor, the political
situation was precarious for the Sultan of Johor at the time. The incumbent
[Sultan of Johor](/wiki/Sultan_of_Johor "Sultan of Johor"), [Tengku Abdul
Rahman](/wiki/Abdul_Rahman_Muazzam_Shah_of_Johor "Abdul Rahman Muazzam Shah of
Johor"), was controlled by the Dutch and the [Bugis](/wiki/Bugis "Bugis"), and
would never agree to a British base in Singapore. However, Abdul Rahman was
Sultan only because his older brother, [Tengku Hussein, also known as Tengku
Long](/wiki/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor "Hussein Shah of Johor"), had been away in
Pahang getting married when their father died. Hussein was then living in
exile in the [Riau Islands](/wiki/Riau_Islands "Riau Islands").[15]

### Singapore Treaty: founding of modern Singapore

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Founding_years_of_modern_Singapore&action=edit&section=3
"Edit section: Singapore Treaty: founding of modern Singapore")]

With the Temenggong's help, Raffles smuggled Tengku Hussein to Singapore. He
offered to recognize Hussein as the rightful Sultan of Johor, and provide him
with a yearly payment; in return, Hussein would grant the British East India
Company the right to establish a trading post on Singapore.[11] In the
agreement, Sultan Hussein would receive a yearly sum of 5,000 Spanish dollars,
with the Temenggong receiving a yearly sum of 3,000 Spanish dollars.[16] This
agreement was ratified with the [Treaty of
Singapore](/wiki/1819_Singapore_Treaty "1819 Singapore Treaty") signed on 6
February 1819.[17][18] This is recognised as the official founding of modern
Singapore[19] and also the beginning as a British settlement.[20]

## Early growth (1819–1826)

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Founding_years_of_modern_Singapore&action=edit&section=4

drawing of the settlement on Singapore as viewed from the sea in 1823. The
drawing shows buildings on the High Street with [Fort Canning
Hill](/wiki/Fort_Canning_Hill "Fort Canning Hill") known then simply as "The
Hill" in the background.[21]

Raffles returned to [British Bencoolen](/wiki/British_Bencoolen "British
Bencoolen") (Sumatra) the day after the signing of the treaty, leaving Major
[William Farquhar](/wiki/William_Farquhar "William Farquhar") as the
[Resident](/wiki/Resident_\(title\) "Resident \(title\)") and Commandant of
the new settlement,[16] supported initially by some artillery and a single
regiment of Indian soldiers. Establishing a trading port from scratch was in
itself a daunting prospect, but Farquhar's administration was, in addition,
practically unfunded, as Raffles did not wish his superiors to view Singapore
as a liability. In addition, it was forbidden from earning revenue by imposing
port duties, Raffles having decided from the outset that Singapore would be a
[free port](/wiki/Free_port "Free port").[11]

In spite of these difficulties, the new colony rapidly proved to be a
spectacular success. As news of the free port spread across the archipelago,
Bugis, [Peranakan Chinese](/wiki/Peranakan "Peranakan"), and [Arab](/wiki/Arab
"Arab") traders flocked to the island, seeking to circumvent the Dutch trading
restrictions. During the first year of operation, $400,000 ([Spanish
dollars](/wiki/Spanish_dollar "Spanish dollar")) worth of trade passed through
Singapore. It has been estimated that when Raffles arrived in 1819, the total
population of the whole of Singapore was around a thousand, mostly of various
local tribes.[22] By 1821, the island's population had increased to around
five thousand, and the trade volume was $8 million. By 1825, the population
had passed the ten thousand mark, with a trade volume of $22 million. (By
comparison, the trade volume for the long-established port of Penang was $8.5
million during the same year.)[11]

Raffles returned to Singapore in 1822. Although Farquhar had successfully led
the settlement through its difficult early years, Raffles was critical of many
of the decisions he had made. For instance, in order to generate much-needed
revenue for the government, Farquhar had resorted to selling licenses for
[gambling](/wiki/Gambling "Gambling") and the sale of opium, which Raffles saw
as social evils. Raffles was also appalled by the slave trade tolerated by
Farquhar.[23] Raffles arranged for the dismissal of Farquhar, who was replaced
by [John Crawfurd](/wiki/John_Crawfurd "John Crawfurd"). Raffles took over the
administration himself, and set about drafting a set of new policies for the
settlement.[24]

Raffles banned slavery, closed all gambling dens, prohibited the carrying of
weapons, and imposed heavy taxation to discourage what he considered vices
such as drunkenness and opium smoking.[24] Raffles, dismayed at the disarray
of the colony, also arranged to organise Singapore into functional and ethnic
subdivisions under the drafted [Raffles Plan of
Singapore](/wiki/Raffles_Plan_of_Singapore "Raffles Plan of Singapore").[11]

Further agreements of the Malay chiefs would gradually erode their influence
and control over Singapore. In December 1822, the Malay chiefs' claim to
Singapore's revenue was changed to a monthly payment. On 7 June 1823, Raffles
arranged for another agreement with the Sultan and Temenggong to buy out their
judicial power and rights to the lands except for the areas reserved for the
Sultan and Temenggong.[24] They would give up their rights to numerous
functions on the island, including the collection of port taxes, in return for
lifelong monthly payments of $1,500 and $800 respectively.[25] This agreement
brought the island squarely under British law, with the proviso that it would
take into account Malay customs, traditions and religious practices, "where
they shall not be contrary to reason, justice or humanity."[24]

A further treaty, the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, was arranged by the
second Resident John Crawfurd with the Malay chiefs and signed on 2 August
1824 to replace the Singapore Treaty. Singapore, including its nearby islands,
was officially fully ceded to the East India Company, and in return, the
chiefs would have their debts cancelled and receive an allowance for life,
with each given an additional lump sum of 20,000 Spanish dollars.[26]

After installing John Crawfurd, an efficient and frugal administrator, as the
new governor, Raffles departed for Britain in October 1823.[27] He would never
return to Singapore. Most of his personal possessions were lost after his
ship, the _Fame_ , caught fire and sank, and he died only a few years later,
in 1826, at the age of 44.[28]

## Straits Settlements

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Founding_years_of_modern_Singapore&action=edit&section=6
"Edit section: Straits Settlements")]

Main article: [Singapore in the Straits
Settlements](/wiki/Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements "Singapore in the
Straits Settlements")

The status of Singapore as a British possession was cemented by the [Anglo-
Dutch Treaty of 1824](/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Treaty_of_1824 "Anglo-Dutch Treaty of
1824"), which divided the Malay archipelago between the two colonial powers.
The area north of the [Straits of Malacca](/wiki/Straits_of_Malacca "Straits
of Malacca"), including [Penang](/wiki/Penang "Penang"),
[Malacca](/wiki/Malacca "Malacca"), and Singapore, was designated as the
British sphere of influence, while the area south of the Straits was assigned
to the Dutch.[29]

This division had far-reaching consequences for the region: modern-day
[Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia "Malaysia") and Singapore correspond to the British
area established in the treaty, and modern-day [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia
"Indonesia") to the Dutch. In 1826, Singapore was grouped together with Penang
and Malacca into a single administrative unit, the [Straits
Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements "Straits Settlements"), under the
[British East India Company](/wiki/British_East_India_Company "British East
India Company").[29]
